rock	I was blinded by the devil, Born already ruined, Stone-cold dead As I stepped out of the womb. By His grace I have been touched, By His word I have been healed, By His hand I've been delivered, By His spirit I've been sealed. I've been saved By the blood of the lamb, Saved By the blood of the lamb, Saved, Saved, And I'm so glad. Yes, I'm so glad, I'm so glad, So glad, I want to thank You, Lord, I just want to thank You, Lord, Thank You, Lord. By His truth I can be upright, By His strength I do endure, By His power I've been lifted, In His love I am secure. He bought me with a price, Freed me from the pit, Full of emptiness and wrath And the fire that burns in it. I've been saved By the blood of the lamb, Saved By the blood of the lamb, Saved, Saved, And I'm so glad. Yes, I'm so glad, I'm so glad, So glad, I want to thank You, Lord, I just want to thank You, Lord, Thank You, Lord. Nobody to rescue me, Nobody would dare, I was going down for the last time, But by His mercy I've been spared. Not by works, But by faith in Him who called, For so long I've been hindered, For so long I've been stalled.

You only had to say the word I would have turned around and heard But as it is we can't turn back The mind's just a trash can, baby And the memories, rolling dice We had something one time, girl, But we thought about it twice When we ran when we ran When we ran When we ran We ran we ran we ran When we ran When we ran

rock	Quand tes cheveux s’étalent Comme un soleil d’été Et que ton oreiller Ressemble aux champs de blé Quand l'ombre et la lumière Dessinent sur ton corps Des montagnes, des forêts Et des îles aux trésors Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime Quand ta bouche se fait douce Quand ton corps se fait dur Quand le ciel dans tes yeux D'un seul coup n'est plus pur Quand tes mains voudraient bien Quand tes doigts n'osent pas Quand ta pudeur dit non D'une toute petite voix Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime Quand tu ne te sens plus chatte Et que tu deviens chienne Et qu'à l'appel du loup Tu brises enfin tes chaînes Quand ton premier soupir Se finit dans un cri Quand c'est moi qui dis non Quand c'est toi qui dis oui Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime Quand mon corps sur ton corps Lourd comme un cheval mort Ne sait pas, ne sait plus S'il existe encore Quand on a fait l'amour Comme d'autres font la guerre Quand c'est moi le soldat Qui meurt et qui la perd Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime Que je t'aime Que je t'aime

rock	Alicia, sortilegio de babia En el fondo del espejo. Alicia, ni supone ni piensa, Con la luna por cerebro. Alicia, en su pensamiento, Tirando del hilo de su enredo. Alicia, en el laberinto, Sin minotauro, me llama: ¡Teseo! Alicia es siempre tan breve Que ya ha terminado. Alicia dice que te quiere Cuando ya te ha abandonado. Alicia expulsada Al país de las maravillas. Para Alicia, hoy, Es siempre todavía. Alicia, viajando entre lunas, De charla con musarañas. Alicia, tejiendo las nubes, Con tela que nunca se acaba. Alicia es siempre tan breve Que ya ha terminado. Alicia dice que te quiere Cuando ya te ha abandonado. Alicia expulsada al país de las maravillas.

I just looked at him and laughed and said 'Cause it's songs about me And who I am Songs about loving and living And good hearted women and family and God Yeah they're all just Songs about me Songs about me So I offered him tickets I said you'll see what I mean If you show up tonight He said I doubt you'll change my opinion I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try Then later on when we finished our songs About scars and cars and broken hearts I saw him, he was standing there Right next to the stage And he shouted Man you were right It was like you sang those Songs about me And who I am Songs about loving and living And good hearted women and family and God Yeah they're all just Songs about me Songs about me So I'll just keep on singing 'Til I hear the whole world singing those Songs about me And who I am Songs about loving and living And good hearted women and family and God Yeah they're all just Songs about me Songs about me
country	I never felt as helpless, as I do today My world just fell around me as I watched you drive away There's nothing left between us, somehow we've grown apart Cause I've got through my head, I just can't break it to my heart [Chorus:] I can't believe this is me on the hurting side of pain Sifting through the ashes still trying to find a flame But the flame has turned to embers left glowing in the dark I've got it through my head, I just can't break it to my heart If I could, Lord knows I would spin back the hands of time And piece these scattered memories that are cluttered in my head Pick up where we left off and make a brand new start I've got it through my head, I just can't break it to my heart [Chorus] Oh I've got it through my head, I just can't break it to my heart I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart Just can't break it to my heart I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart
country	I like blue eyes, hers are green Not like the woman of my dreams And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned Five foot three isn't tall She's not the girl I pictured at all In those paint by number fantasies I've had So it took me by complete surprise When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes She's not at all what I was looking for She's more No, it wasn't at first sight But the moment I looked twice I saw the woman I was born to love Her laughter fills my soul And when I hold her I don't want to let go When it comes to her I can't get enough So it took me by complete surprise When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes She's not at all what I was looking for She's more More than I dreamed of More than any man deserves I couldn't ask for more Than a love like hers So it took me by complete surprise When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes She's not at all what I was looking for She's more.
country	We met at the broken spoke restaurant and lounge I lit your cigarette and then you wrote your number down On the inside of a matchbook that was laying on the bar And a fire started burning somewhere in my heart I didn't see it coming, guess I didn't read the signs I just never thought you'd leave me after all this time But today when I came home my key was hollow in the door And there was nothing but a worn out book of matches on the floor You took the bed You took the dishes and the car You broke my trust You took advantage of my heart You left me here With empty rooms and walls with holes and scars and scratches If I find the strength to burn you memories down At least you left the matches The color's old and faded the cover's worn and stained But i can still make out the numbers and the heart beside your name Until tonight they'd only lit a single cigarette Now one by one I'm striking them to help me to forget And everybody at the broken spoke All thought my crazy story was a joke Now they're out there in the parking lot Staring at the smoke You took the bed You took the dishes and the car You broke my trust You took advantage of my heart You left me here With empty rooms and walls with holes and scars and scratches And the hurt I need to burn those memories down At least you left the matches Baby all that's left of our love now is ashes Thank God you left the matches
country	Wherever I'm goin', wherever I'm stayin' It doesn't matter, long as I'm stayin' with you, stayin' with you I'm always happy, whatever I'm doin' It doesn't matter, long as I do it with you, do it with you I may never have much silver and gold But, I've got something more precious and warmer to hold And that old rockin' chair don't scare me, like it used to It doesn't matter, as long as I'm rockin' with you Wherever I'm workin', whatever it's payin' It doesn't matter, long as it's workin' with you, workin' with you These things I believe in, some people call dreamin' It doesn't matter, long as I'm dreamin' with you, dreamin' with you I may never have much silver and gold But, I've got something more precious and warmer to hold And that old rockin' chair don't scare me, like it used to It doesn't matter, as long as I'm rockin' with you No, it doesn't matter, as long as I'm rockin' with you No, it doesn't matter, as long as I'm rockin' with you As long as I'm rockin' with you
country	Traveling the lonely roads of sorrow, Heartaches are all I've ever known. Time has turned a million pages, Fate has dealt and I'm alone. [Chorus] But somewhere along life's highway From your new love you may part, And you will reap the pains, my darling, That go with a broken heart. The little stars all twinkled brighter, The moon smiled gaily from the blue. The flowers seemed to spread more beauty Oh, so glad 'cause I met you. [Chorus] Though you've made my life a failure, I have never been untrue. And these lonely years have wasted, All because my love for you. [Chorus] You played your game to leave me darling, Your game I did not understand. So you dealt the cards against me And I played the losing hand. [Chorus]
country	I know where I'm goin' Don't you want to come too?

I know my destination It's a' waitng for me I got no hesitation That's where I want to be And by the time that the sun comes up I'll be drinkin' from a lovin' cup I know where I'm goin' Don't you want to come too? I know why I'm singin' Don't you want to sing too? Can't you hear the bells a ringin'? Let the spirit move you Just close your eyes and let it flow Lean your head back, let it go I know where I'm goin' Don't you want to come too? I know why I'm singin' Don't you want to sing too?

country	The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin') A harder ridin' bunch of outlaws no one ever saw I don't recall the lawman that could match or beat the draw The rode the west, they fought the best The never lost a fight They did their hidin' in the daytime Ridin' most at night The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin') They rode into Yuma on a hot September day Hit the bank and got the gold and then they rode away The sheriff tried to stop 'em but he didn't really try The sheriff thought too much of life And he didn't wanna die The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin') The governor of the territory called the rangers in The rangers caught the outlaws and the fightin' did begin For seven hours they fought and there were bodies all around Not one body of an outlaw lay upon the ground The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin') They only took the money that the rich got by their greed And gave it to the ranchers who were desperately in need They'd ride into the poorest section of a border town Evenly distributed to the poorest of the town The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin') Maybe it was wrong to steal, but was it wrong to give? They took many chances so a friend in need might live One by one they've gone but still there's one alive to tell The outlaws never failed to hear it when a friend would yell The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin')
country	A man can only last so long. Before temptation gets too strong. But I'm doin' all I know to do. To try and stay away from you. You got me right on the Borderline. [Chorus] Borderline. Don't let me cross over. She's right behind me in the moonlight. Lord knows I've tried to think of my lover. Borderline. Don't let me cross her tonight. You know I got a woman at home. That I sure hate to leave alone. But still you just keep comin' on like I'm not made of flesh and bone. You got me right on the Borderline. Promises are easy made. In the heat of passion, light of day. But let that daylight start to fade and your best laid plans might get mis-layed. When you're right on the Borderline. [Chorus] [Chorus] Borderline. Don't let me cross her tonight.

country	A orchid is a flower that blooms so tenderly It thrills the fairest lady of the land If placed beside a blushing rose the rose could not compare But how was such as I, to understand. I overlooked an orchid while searching for a rose The orchid that I overlooked was you. The rose that I was searching for has proved to be untrue The orchid that I find my dear was you. The rose has lost its color, but the orchid stays the same And I'm alone to face these lonely years I didn't see the orchid, I was searching for a rose And now I pay the price with bitter tears. I overlooked an orchid while searching for a rose The orchid that I overlooked was you The rose that I was searching for has proved to be untrue The orchid that I find my dear was you. The orchid that I find my dear was you

I'm the same man that I used to be Did you forget who I am? I'm the man with the master plan But every day's the same Nothing seems to change My life is just minutes away And all I wanted to do was dance How could this happen to me? I had it all worked out to a T Went through it with a fine toothed comb Now you want to leave me alone Every day's the same Nothing seems to change My life is just minutes away And all I wanted to do was dance I didn't ask for much I maybe didn't ask for enough I maybe should've forced your hand But all I wanted to do was dance
country	See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans, Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams, Which he spent like they was goin' outta style And he keeps right on a'changin' for the better or the worse, Searchin' for a shrine he's never found Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse, Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down He's a poet, he's a picker He's a prophet, he's a pusher He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction, Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home. He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars, And he's traded in tomorrow for today Runnin' from his devils, lord, and reachin' for the stars, And losin' all he's loved along the way But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse, And all he ever gets is older and around >from the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse, The goin' up was worth the comin' down He's a poet, he's a picker He's a prophet, he's a pusher He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction, Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home. There's a lotta wrong directions on that lonely way back home.
country	Don't be angry with me darling if I fail to understand All your little whims and wishes all the time Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine Well I recall the first time that I flirted with you dear When I jokingly said come and be my bride Now the time has turned the pages it's the sweetest joke on earth That I have you dear forever by my side Maybe someday you're gonna hurt me I've been hurt in love before Only God can know and time alone will tell But in the mean time I'll keep loving you with all my heart and soul And pray God to let it last if it's his will Don't be angry with me darling
country	Baby, I'm tired of waitin' on you, I'm wearin' out my floor. You've got women waitin' on you,you're like a revolvin' door. You live life so cavalier, but time's not on your side. How much longer will it take until you realize? Short term lovers under covers, Well, now that don't mean a thing. When you find out what you're missin', Well, I hope it ain't too late. 'Cos when you need someone to hold you, When your world comes tumblin' down; I'll be there if you ever need me, True love won't let you down. My friends think I'm crazy, they say I'm wastin' my time. They don't see the magic that you hold in your eyes. Maybe it's those baby blues that keeps me hypnotized. I might be a dreamer, but my heart you can't deny: Short term lovers under covers, Well, now that don't mean a thing. When you find out what you're missin', Well, I hope it ain't too late.

country	Written by George Jones and Jack Ripley I won't say that I'm the only one who loves her And I won't say I make her happy all the time There's someone she can't forget I know she never will, and yet But as far as my heart's concerned, she's mine She never once has told me that she needs me And she forgets when I'm around her all the time There are words I try to say When she turns and walks away But as far as my heart's concerned, she's mine She's mine and yet I know someday I'll lose her But she'll never take this happiness I've found And I know it may sound foolish when I tell you That I'm satisfied just having her around Even when she's in my arms I know she's lonely I wish that I could take that someone from her mind But since her mother left our world She's been daddy's little girl She's a baby, I'm her daddy, and she's mine

country	Here's a song I wrote on a plane between Dallas and Austin Goin' to El Paso Whoops Now this is what gave us the idea to come down here, This is a song about a guy that probably did as much for Our kind of music as anybody. Well the Honky Tonks in Texas were my natural second home The way you tip your hat to the ladies in the rose of San Antone I grew up on music that we call western swing It don't matter whose in Austin, Bob Wills is still the King Lord, I can still remember the way things were back then In spite of all the hard times I'd live it all again To hear the Texas Playboys and Tommy Duncan sing Makes me proud to be from Texas where Bob Wills is still the King You can hear the Grand Ol' Opry in Nashville Tennessee Its the home of country music on that we all agree But when you cross that ol' Red River hoss, That just don't mean a thing Once you're down in Texas, Bob Wills is still the King If you ain't never been there, then I guess you aint been told That you just can't live in Texas unless you got alot of soul Its the home of Willie Nelson, the home of western swing He'll be the first to tell you, Bob Wills is still the King.

country	As he stared past the fire, His hunger to leave well it gnawed his poor heart alive, Her skin smelled like black cherry, blossom perfume, The sail boats they all sailed by And a river she cried. And the wind was suddenly sweeter? than Roosevelt pine, The windows broke out and the cigarette smoke drifted by, The bums on the bowery were swallowed in the lights as cars rumbled by in the night Screaming run for your life. With cool and silvery eyes And a heart was fit for desire, Drowned in a river of tears Oh a river? she cried left her with a heart Made of ashes and fire. One day there was a silence and it washed through the town, There was no reason to speak and no one made a sound, Her eyes were indigo and the cats were all calico And the sail boats they all sailed by And a river she cried. With cool and silvery eyes And a? heart that was fit for desire, Drowned in a river of tears Oh a river she cried left her with a heart Made of ashes and fire Ashes and fire Ashes and fire Ashes and fire

Now, she's begging to another With that same hurt in her eyes She don't know how much it hurts me To see an angel cry I didn't know how much I loved her Till she turned and walked away I didn't know how much I'd hurt her Till I saw her here this way.

Those simple things you gave are worth the world to me And each up when I cling to you can take memories So many things were left unsaid, I don't know where to start How can I write on paper what I feel in my heart? How can I write on paper, what I'm feeling deep inside Words to you would last no longer, then it take tear to dry A love as sweet as your and mine, deserve another start How can I write on paper what I feel in my heart?

country	I am a clock without hands I'm walking through the midnights Counting all the moments Of the loves I've left behind Crying on the shoulders of the days I've not forgotten now I am frozen in time Like the battles of the soldiers Left displaced of time Where their tears still fall Loves that wreck out on the track Far beyond my looking back to recall I'm just a clock upon the shelf Without hands to give the time of day For love at all [Chorus:] I am a clock without hands No one understands this That when the autumn comes I see no reason for a fall Spring can fail to move me With its tulips and its clover Now the time for love is over I am a clock without hands I'm just tickin' and that's all I am a clock without hands I'm just tickin' and that's all I recall a time When love still had the power To reach inside this clock Where my hands held a dream The innocence of passion And the words of Saint Teresa chiming in And I recall the faith Of the love of my life And the losing of my hands Which he took with him when he died I'm crying on the shoulders of his love That I'm remembering now It's been ages since this heart has ticked a beat of love So I've forgotten how [Chorus]

country	Sitting at the kitchen table Monday afternoon house is so quiet. I spent the morning looking for a job but the job markets pretty tight And I'm wondering just what I'm gonna do, Someone to hold and the rent I owe are long overdue. Seems like everything comes down to money and love in my life. It seems like everything comes down to money and love in my life. I'm used to having a woman around, cooking for me and when I lay down to love. I got used to having a woman around looking to me to rise above. I've got a lonely heart, two open arms, and a pillow I never use. I know it ain't much to offer but its the best I can do. Seems like everything comes down to money and love in my life. I've loved a lot of good women and I could sure love one now. I've had more then enough money in my bank account, But where they went and how it got spent isn't really clear. They just left me here and it all disappeared. Sitting in another office Tuesday morning, application filled. I doubt they'll ever call me but I can't keep from hoping that they will. I know I need to keep my chin up but I'm telling you the truth, If there's no one else to live for is there anything left to lose? It seems like everything comes down to money and love in my life. Seems like everything comes down to money and love in my life. In my life.

country	While strolling through a lovely garden As day was drawing to a close My eyes beheld a tragic story I saw a teardrop on a rose. It should have been a tear of gladness But deep inside the sorrow shows A trusting heart had just been broken I saw a teardrop on a rose. A sobbing tear that follows parting Holds all the pain that sorrow knows A false goodbye, a life is shattered There lies a story on a rose. The tear will dry the rose will wither When spring and winter comes and goes I loved, I lost, my story ended With just a teardrop on a rose.
country	All my friends ask what can they do To help me get over you But I'm not blue and all broken in two Why should I miss you? Cause you'll be back every night in my dreams You'll be back, and it won't even seem Like your gone, no I won't be alone Cause you'll be back every night in my dreams. Walk the floor and cry until dawn Watch the door and sit by the phone Oh, no not me why worry and moan Just because you're gone. Cause you'll be back every night in my dreams You'll be back, and it won't even seem Like your gone, no I won't be alone Cause you'll be back every night in my dreams. Cause you'll be back every night in my dreams You'll be back, and it won't even seem Like your gone, no I won't be alone Cause you'll be back every night in my dreams. Cause you'll be back every night in my dreams You'll be back, and it won't even seem Like your gone, no I won't be alone Cause you'll be back every night in my dreams...

You babe, you're my bestest friend Who takes me home when I get too drunk to dance? And who bravely puts up with my uncles and my aunts? And who discreetly whispers I forgot to zip your pants? You babe, you're my bestest friend And who comes down and bails me out when I get in a jam? And helps me tell the police where I live and who I am? And who pats my back when no one else could give a damn? You babe, you're my bestest friend And who can be as gentle as a sparrow in my hand Meaner than a junkyard dog when she's fighting for her man? And who's the only one I'll ever love and understand? You babe, you're my bestest friend Talking about you babe, you're my bestest friend

country	[Chorus] Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind A restless wind that yearns to wander And he was born the next of kin The next of kin to the wayward wind In a lonely shack by a railroad track He spent his younger days And I guess the sound of the outward bound Made him a slave to his wanderin' ways [Chorus] Oh, I met him there in a border town He vowed we'd never part Tho' he tried his best to settle down Now I'm alone with a broken heart [Chorus] The next of kin to the wayward wind
country	I ain’t rich, but I damn sure wanna be Working like a dog all day, ain’t working for me I wish I had a rich uncle that’d kick the bucket And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett I know everybody says Money can’t buy happiness But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets Yeah, and I know what they say Money can’t buy everything Well, maybe so, But it could buy me a boat They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle I’m sure that’s probably true, But it still sounds pretty cool 'Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets Yeah, and I know what they say, Money can’t buy everything Well, maybe so, But it could buy me a boat To float down on the water with a beer I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sitting’ on a hundred mill Well, that would buy me a brand new rod and reel And it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets Yeah, and I know what they say, Money can’t buy everything Well, maybe so, But it could buy me a boat Yeah, and I know what they say, Money can’t buy everything Well, maybe so, But it could buy me a boat It could buy me a boat
country	Hands that are strong but wrinkled Doing work that never gets done Hair, that's lost some of the beauty By too many hours in the sun Eyes, that show some disappointment And there's been quite a lot in her life She's the foundation I lean on My woman, my woman, my wife Everyday has been uphill Oh, we climb but we can't reach the top I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged She just smiles when I want to stop Lips, that are weary but tender With love, that strengthens my life A saint, in a dress made of gingham My woman, my woman, my wife Two little babies were born in the spring But died when the winter was new I lost control of my mind and my soul But my woman's faith carried us through When she reaches that river Lord, you know what she's worth Give her that mansion up yonder 'Cause she's been through hell here on earth Lord, give her my share of Heaven If I've earned any here in this life 'Cause God, I believe she deserves it My woman, my woman, my wife
country	Sometimes when I'm down and all alone Just like a child without a home The love you give me keeps me hangin' on Oh honey, all I ever need is you You're my first love, you're my last You're my future, you're my past And loving you is all I ask, honey All I ever need is you Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do Give me a reason to build my world around you Some men follow rainbows, I am told Some men search for silver some for gold I have found my treasure in your soul, honey All I ever need is you Without love I'd never find the way Through ups and downs of every single day I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey All I ever need is you
country	"You know, every time I look in the mirror I see my Dad I think that's why this song means so much to me When I was young My dad would say ""C'mon son, let's go out and play"" Sometimes it seems like yesterday And I'd climb up the closet shelf When I was all by myself Grab his hat and fix the brim Pretending I was him No matter, how hard I try No matter, how many tears I cry No matter, how many years go by I still can't say goodbye He always took care Of Mom and me We all cut down a Christmas tree He always had some time for me Wind blows through the trees Street lights, they still shine bright Most things are the same But I miss my dad tonight I walked by a Salvation Army store Saw a hat like my daddy wore Tried it on when I walked in Still trying to be like him No matter, how hard I try No matter, how many years go by No matter, how many tears I cry I still can't say goodbye"
country	I thought about walkin' thought about talkin' thought about singin' singin' the blues Thought about tryin' once I even thought of dyin' But baby most of all I thought about you Thought of just bein' people I'm seein' thought about doin' the things they do Thought about livin' thought about forgivin' but baby most of all I thought about you Thought of bein' born thought of bein' warm Bout all the things a man can go through Thought of winds a blowin' and rivers overflowin' But baby most of all I thought about you Thought of just bein' Most of all I thought about you
country	I got kicked off Noah's Ark I turn my cheek to unkind remarks There was two of everything But one of me And when the rains came tumbling down I held my breath and I stood my ground And I watched that ship go sailing Out to sea. [Chorus] Take it back Take it back Oh no, you can't say that All of my friends Are not dead or in jail Through rock and through stone The black wind still moans Sweet revenge Sweet revenge Without fail. I caught an isle seat on a plane And drove an English teacher half insane Making up jokes about bicycle spokes And red balloons So I called up my local deejay And he didn't have a lot to say But the radio Has learned all of my favourite tunes. [Chorus] The white meat is on the run And the dark meat is far too done And the milkman left me a note yesterday Get out of this town by noon You're coming on way too soon And besides that We never liked you any way. [Chorus]
country	Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep You showed me how this town can shatter dreams Another lesson about a naive fool that came to Babylon And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music Lonely, lonely streets that I call home Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives And painful scars are all that's left of me Oh but thank you girl for teaching me brand new ways to be cruel If I can find my mind now, I guess I'll just leave And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music Lonely, lonely streets that I call home Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music Lonely, lonely streets that I call home Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on

country	There was a lady in a window In the room across the way From the hotel I was staying in While on my holiday I couldn't help but see everything 'Cause I was peeping I confess Still after dinner every night She had the strangest guest She'd retire to her favorite chair And sit there with a dog Fill the crystal glasses While the fire danced on the log I watched them drink their bubbly brew Until the fire grew dim Then I stuck my head out the window And said why not me instead of him Oh your bulldog drinks champagne And I ain't one to complain What a perfect waste of wine it seems to be So honey, tell ol' rover that the big dog's coming over 'Cause any woman that would get a bulldog drunk Would have to be good to me Fourteen days and fourteen nights Not one word did I hear Her with her silk and champagne Over to me in my shorts with a beer She just left the curtains wide And I knew she knew I could see Her and the pug-nosed mutt Guzzling wine and teasing me Oh your bulldog drinks champagne And I ain't one to complain What a perfect waste of wine it seems to be So honey, tell ol' rover that the big dog's coming over 'Cause any woman that would get a bulldog drunk Would have to be good to me So I made a bolder move I went over and rang her bell I heard growling from inside And I got scared as hell Then the bulldog staggered out the door And he said, how do yo do But the lady bit me on the leg And I said are-rouf, I love you too Oh your bulldog drinks champagne And I ain't one to complain What a perfect waste of wine it seems to be So honey, tell ol' rover that the big dog's coming over 'Cause any woman that would get a bulldog drunk Would have to be good to me
country	My son my son I pray that you'll come home to me my son my son It seems only yesterday the most important thing on your mind Was whether you'd make the baseball team or get the new school jacket Like all the other kids had And I remember how your eyes lighted up when you got your first rod and reel For that big fishing trip just you and your dad And I remember wiping the tears away when you hurt yourself on your sled In those days it seems the house was filled with laughter and joy Filled with your friends and they were all such good boys And then came the day that you walked down the aisle To receive that all important diploma I was so proud but I couldn't believe that tall young man was my son my wonderful son And then I remember the little girl that was always around kinda tagging after you She's not so little anymore but she's still around who knows maybe someday Then you received the call that I guess we knew would come someday But it came so quick and now you're so very far away In the land that until a short time ago I didn't even know was there I know the time will pass you'll be home again But until that time my darling take care take special care My son my son I pray that you'll come home to me my son my son
country	Blue Kentucky highway, headin' for the line She hadn't said a word all night, But the wheels are turnin' in her mind Now I was ridin' shotgun, And I knew things had gone awry Just as soon as she dropped me off At the side of the road And she let that gravel fly Now I'm walkin' in the moonlight, Seein' nothin' but the taillights And that's a pair of taillights I may never see again She hit me with the left and right, Showin' me nothin' but the taillights And that's about as lonely As the highway's ever been Back here with my thumb out in the wind Was it somethin' that I did to her, Or the things I never said I wonder if the way we were was only in my head Now if I even make it back to town Before the sun comes up I'm gonna hit every parking spot around 'Til I find that pick-up truck Now I'm talkin' in the moonlight Seein' nothin' but the taillights And that's a pair of taillights I may never see again She hit me with the left and right Showin' me nothin' but the taillights And that's about as lonely As a highway's ever been Stuck here with my thumb out in the wind Well I'll bet right now she's laughin' At how she brought me to my knees But she won't be laughin' half as loud When she gives me back my keys She'll be walkin' in the moonlight, Seein' nothin' but the taillights And that's a pair of taillights She won't ever see again She hit me with a left and right And with nothin' but the taillights And I know that's about as lonely As a highway's ever been Back here with my thumb out in the wind There she goes, here I come
country	The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean, But you don't care how many tears I cry And though you only lead me on and hurt me, I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye Cause everybody's somebody's fool Everybody's somebody's plaything And there are no exceptions to the rule Yes, everybody's somebody's fool I told myself it's best that I forget you, Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score Yet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you It hurts, but I'd come running back for more Cause everybody's somebody's fool Everybody's somebody's plaything And there are no exceptions to the rule Yes, everybody's somebody's fool Someday you'll find someone you really care for And if her love should prove to be untrue, You'll know how much this heart of my is breakin' You'll cry for her the way I cried for you Yes, everybody's somebody's fool Everybody's somebody's plaything And there are no exceptions to the rule Yes, everybody's somebody's fool
country	Just like a re-run movie I see that scene again And that feeling shoots right through me 'Cause this time I know the end And I've seen it played so many times And I've watched it frame by frame And I don't have to guess who loses And I know who'll feel the pain [Chorus] You're gonna leave me again Just like you did the time before This is the start of the end The end of me when you walk out that door I think I'll go down to the picture show See if they're playin' somethin' new Maybe one with a happy ending And I'll pretend it's me and you But I know that it's just make-believe So I won't even try To tell myself that you're not gonna leave And that you'll never say goodbye [Chorus]
country	I can't stop loving you so I've made up my mind To live in memory of old lonesome times I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday Those happy hours that we once knew though long ago they still make me blue They say that time heels a broken heart But time has stood still since we've been apart I can't stop loving you
country	A heartache for a keepsake What a tragic souvenir Now I know how it feels When peoples dreams all disappear I'm looking out my window Watching her just walk away A heartache for a keepsake It became mine just today A picture fades with time But will a heartache do the same Years from now will I still Wake up nights and call her name Oh it hurts to love somebody And to see her walk away A heartache for a keepsake It became mine just today A picture fades with time But will a heartache do the same Years from now will I still Wake up nights and call her name Oh it hurts to love somebody And to see her walk away A heartache for a keepsake It became mine just today

country	The clatter of the garbage cans in the dark and lonely alley Searching for a bottle with a drop or two of wine The wino makes his rounds from garbage cans to gutter Running like a wild man to every bottle that he finds The wine makes him happy for a little while but this world of fantasy don't last long Then his frail lonely body seeks refuge but he's lost in a world of his own What would cause a man to give up everything life has to offer And end up with no family no home no nothing Sleeping on the ground in some fifty alley Holding tight in his hand an empty wine bottle In his eyes a look of sadness as though he's just seen the gates of hell Could it be that he's loved and lost or could it be that he was lost and unloved Whatever it might be it's a pitiful sight to see a man knows only as a wino
country	"With this ring I Thee wed an angel here beside me, A moment more and heaven will be mine. With this ring I Thee wed as ev'ry dream inside me. Comes true each time I hear the church bells chime. This little band of gold I hold will soon be on your finger, A vow and now that moment so divine. With this ring I Thee wed, and make you mine forever To have and to hold until the end of time. With our hearts tied as one we leave the church together, Together as we know we'll always be. In a life just begun this day will live forever Like blossoms in a treasured memory. Your big bouquet may fade away but as the years go by, dear I'll take your hand each day and say anew: With this ring I Thee wed, I vow I love you truly And every day you'll hear me say ""I do."""

[Chorus] You don't see no city when you look at me ""'Cause, country's all I am I love runnin' bare naked through the old corn fields And I love that country Ham-ha-ham Well, you say I'm made just to fit your plans But does a barnyard shovel fit your hands If your eyes are on me You're lookin' at country This here country is a little green And there's a lot of country that-a you ain't seen I'll show you around if you'll show me a wedding band I said a weddin' band When it comes to love, well, I know about that Country folks all know where it's at If you're lookin' at me Your lookin' at country [Chorus]"
country	Hey Baby, Is that you? Wow your hair got so long. Yea, yea! I love it, I really do. Norma Jean ain't that the song We'd sing in the car Drivin' down town, Top down makin' the rounds, Checkin' out the bands on Dull Hinney Avenue. Yea life throws you curves, But you learned to swerve. Me I swung and I miss And the next thing you know I'm reminiscing. Dreaming old dreams, Wishing old wishes, Like we would be back again. I wake up and tear drops, They fall down like rain. I put on that old song we danced to and then, I head off to my job, Guess not much has changed. Punch the clock. Head for home. Check the phone, Just in case. Go to bed, Dream of you, That's what I'm doing these days. Yea that's what I'm doing. Someone told me, after college, You ran off to Vegas, You married a rodeo cowboy...why That ain't the girl I knew. Me I've been a few places, Mostly here and there once or twice. Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright. Yea, It's good to see you too. Well hey girl, you're late. And those planes they don't wait. But if you ever come back around This sleepy old town, Promise me you'll stop in To see an old friend, And until then I wake up and tear drops, They fall down like rain. I put on that old song we danced to and then, I head off to my job, Guess not much has changed. Punch the clock. Head for home. Check the phone, Just in case. Go to bed, Dream of you, That's what I'm doing these days. I wake up and tear drops, They fall down like rain. I put on that old song we danced to and then, I wake up and tear drops, They fall down like rain. I put on that old song we danced to and then, I wake up and tear drops, They fall down like rain. I put on that old song we danced to and then,
country	I live by the river on the wrong side of town Nothing much to do here but listen to the sound Of a train I'll never catch passin' me by Of the muddy water drinkin' the tears that I cry So I head you're comin' back with somebody else Well, if I had the time, if I had a little help Every bridge in Dickson County would be burning down tonight Every bridge in Dickson County would be burning down tonight I have to think of something, I just have to find a way Before you cross that river, before I see your face 'Cause I can see your headlights and I can feel the pain And nothing's gonna save me if I see you again But if I could use this torch I carry to put it all to rights I'd be baptized in the ashes come the morning light And every bridge in Dickson County would be burning down tonight I'd pay the price, I'd take the blame If I could see it all go up in flames And if I could use this torch I carry to put it all to rights But if I could use this torch I carry to put it all to rights Dickson County
country	I had a most distressing dream last night I dreamed I was a crystal bird Caught in perpetual flight I'd ascend and glide and descend and ride On the wind and never alight I had a most distressing dream last night Glass enclosed, exposed wherever I flew With no control and a crystal soul That one could see right through No ethereal nest where I could rest I was frightened by what I knew That my two crystal legs were broken in two When I awoke my heart was beating fast As if all night and endless flight An eternity had passed As I shook my head and slipped from my bed Released from the prism, at last I stepped upon a bit of shattered glass
country	Each night I make the rounds To every spot in town A lonely man with lonely time to kill All I can say is what a way to live The paths my memories take Just make my poor heart ache I think of her I guess I always will All I can say is what a way to live I'd rather lay me down tonight And never wake again Than to face another day the shape my life is in The jukebox playing loud A face among the crowd So much like hers it makes my heart stand still All I can say is what a way to live I'd rather lay me down tonight And never wake again Than to face another day the shape my life is in The jukebox playing loud A face among the crowd So much like hers it makes my heart stand still All I can say is what a way to live All I can say is what a way to live

To really live you must almost die And it happened just that way with me They took my gold and set me free And I walked away from the hanging tree I walked away from the hanging tree And my own true love, she walked with me. That's when I knew that the hanging tree Is the tree of life, new life for me The tree of hope, new hope for me, The tree of love, new love for me, The hanging tree the hanging tree the hanging tree.

country	See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans, Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile-- Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams, Which he spent like they was goin' outta style-- And he keeps right on a'changin' for the better or the worse, Searchin' for a shrine he's never found-- Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse, Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down-- He's a poet, he's a picker-- He's a prophet, he's a pusher-- He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned-- He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction, Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home. He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars, And he's traded in tomorrow for today-- Runnin' from his devils, lord, and reachin' for the stars, And losin' all he's loved along the way-- But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse, And all he ever gets is older and around-- >from the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse, The goin' up was worth the comin' down-- He's a poet, he's a picker-- He's a prophet, he's a pusher-- He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned-- He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction, Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home. There's a lotta wrong directions on that lonely way back home.
country	This is the story of the Yellow Bandana, A handsome young soldier, and the girl named Rosana. Oh, way down west, in the winds on New Mexico. There lived a girl and the soldier who loved her so, And every night 'neath the full crimson moon above, This brave young soldier, would pledge her his love. [Chorus] And he gave Rosana his yellow bandana, To wear in her hair, till he's with her once more. He gave Rosana his yellow bandana, Mounted his pony, and rode off to war. His orders came, and he had to ride west again; Seems that Apaches were causing unrest again. He kissed Rosana goodbye as he rode away, Promising this time he'd come back to stay. [Chorus] That war was over, and he came back home and found That the Apaches had burned the whole village down. And 'neath the tree where he'd last kissed Rosana, Gripped on the cross, was his yellow bandana. [Chorus] He gave Rosana his yellow bandana, To wear in her hair, till he's with her once more. He gave Rosana his yellow bandana, Mounted his pony, and rode off to war...

blues	Look out across the fields, see me returning Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning You've had time to think about it for a while Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over It's the end of the chase and the moon is high It won't matter who loves who, you'll love me or I'll love you When the night comes falling, when the night comes falling When the night comes falling from the sky I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting Sorrow covers you up like a cape Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting With disaster you somehow managed to escape Well, I can't provide for you no easy answers Who are you that I should have to lie You'll know all about it, love it'll fit you like a glove When the night comes falling, when the night comes falling When the night comes falling from the sky I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river You must have been protecting someone last time I called I've never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver I've never asked to set yourself up for a fall I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness For the love of a lousy buck, I've watched them die Stick around, baby, we're not through don't look for me, I'll see you When the night comes falling, when the night comes falling When the night comes falling from the sky In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line I don't want to be a fool starving for affection I don't want to drown in someone else's wine For all eternity I think I will remember That icy wind that's howling in your eye You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind When the night comes falling, when the night comes falling When the night comes falling from the sky Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter But you were gambling for support This time tomorrow I'll know you better Where my memory is not so short This time I'm asking for freedom Freedom from a world which you deny And you'll give it to me now I'll take it anyhow When the night comes falling, when the night comes falling When the night comes falling from the sky

blues	"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird, Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined. But we all return as we live wo learn, That we left our happiness behind. When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,"" It is silver dollars they're looking for. You will find my friend that the rainbow's end, Is somewhere around your kitchen door. The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you, Back in your own back yard, You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane, Back in your own back yard. Oh you can go to the East go to the West, But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from, You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes, Back in your own backyard."

blues	"(Traditional, arranged by Ry Cooder) (G) - (D) (G) I'll sing you a true song of (D) Billy the (G) Kid I'll (D) sing the record of (G) deeds that he did Way out in New Mexico a long time (D) ago When a (G) man's only friend was his (D) own forty- (G) four Now when Billy the Kid was a very young lad In old Silver City he went to the bad Way out west with a knife in his hand At the age of twelve years he killed his first man Fair Mexican maidens play guitars and sing Songs about Billy their boy bandit king Before this young manhood reached its sad end He'd a notch on his pistol for twenty one men It was on one black night that poor Billy died He said to his friends, ""I'm not satisfied There's twenty one men that I've put bullets through And sheriff Pat Garrett's gonna make twenty-two"" Well, this is how Billy the Kid met his fate A big moon was shining and the hour was late Shot down by Pat Garrett, Silver City's best friend The poor outlaw's life have reached its sad end"
blues	And now the purple dusk of twilight time Steals across the meadows of my heart High up in the sky the little stars climb Always reminding me that we're apart You wander down the lane and far away Leaving me a song that will not die Love is now the stardust of yesterday The music of the years gone by. Sometimes I wonder, how I spend The lonely nights Dreaming of a song The melody Haunts my reverie And I am once again with you When our love was new And each kiss an inspiration But that was long ago And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright You are in my arms The nightingale Tells his fairytale Of paradise, where roses grew Though I dream in vain In my heart it will remain My stardust melody The memory of love's refrain.

blues	"The pale moon rose in it's glory Out on the Western town She told a sad, sad story Of the great ship that went down T'was the fourteenth day of April Over the waves she rode Sailing into tomorrow To a golden age foretold The night was black with starlight The seas were sharp and clear Moving through the shadows The promised hour was near Lights were holding steady Gliding over the foam All the lords and ladies Heading for their eternal home The chandeliers were swaying From the balustrades above The orchestra was playing Songs of faded love The watchman, he lay dreaming As the ballroom dancers twirled He dreamed the Titanic was sinking Into the underworld Leo took his sketchbook He was often so inclined He closed his eyes and painted The scenery in his mind Cupid struck his bosom And broke it with a snap The closest woman to him He fell into her lap He heard a loud commotion Something sounded wrong His inner spirit was saying That he couldn't stand here long He staggered to the quarterdeck No time now to sleep Water on the quarterdeck Already three foot deep Smokestack was leaning sideways Heavy feet began to pound He walked into the whirlwind Sky splitting all around The ship was going under The universe had opened wide The roll was called up yonder The angels turned aside Lights down in the hallway Flickering dim and dull Dead bodies already floating In the double bottom hull The engines then exploded Propellers they failed to start The boilers overloaded The ship's bow split apart Passengers were flying Backward, forward, far and fast They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled Each one more weary than the last The veil was torn asunder 'Tween the hours of twelve and one No change, no sudden wonder Could undo what had been done The watchman lay there dreaming At fourty five degrees He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking Dropping to her knees Wellington he was sleeping His bed began to slide His valiant heart was beating He pushed the tables aside Glass of shattered crystal Lay scattered roundabout He strapped on both his pistols How long could he hold out? His men and his companions Were nowhere to be seen In silence there he waited for Time and space to intervene The passageway was narrow There was blackness in the air He saw every kind of sorrow Heard voices everywhere Alarm-bells were ringing To hold back the swelling tide Friends and lovers clinging To each other side by side Mothers and their daughters Descending down the stairs Jumped into the icy waters Love and pity sent their prayers The rich man, Mister Astor Kissed his darling wife He had no way of knowing It'd be the last trip of his life Calvin, Blake and Wilson Gambled in the dark Not one of them would ever live to Tell the tale on the disembark Brother rose up 'gainst brother In every circumstance They fought and slaughtered each other In a deadly dance They lowered down the lifeboats From the sinking wreck There were traitors, there were turncoats Broken backs and broken necks The bishop left his cabin To help others in need Turned his eyes up to the heavens Said, ""The poor are yours to feed"" Davey the brothel-keeper Came out dismissed his girls Saw the water getting deeper Saw the changing of his world Jim Dandy smiled He never learned to swim Saw the little crippled child And he gave his seat to him He saw the starlight shining Streaming from the East Death was on the rampage But his heart was now at peace They battened down the hatches But the hatches wouldn't hold They drowned upon the staircase Of brass and polished gold Leo said to Cleo I think I'm going mad But he'd lost his mind already Whatever mind he had He tried to block the doorway To save all those from harm Blood from an open wound Pouring down his arm Petals fell from flowers 'Til all of them were gone In the long and dreadful hours The wizard's curse played on The host was pouring brandy He was going down slow He stayed right to the end and he Was the last to go There were many, many others Nameless here forever more They never sailed the ocean Or left their homes before The watchman, he lay dreaming The damage had been done He dreamed the Titanic was sinking And he tried to tell someone The captain, barely breathing Kneeling at the wheel Above him and beneath him Fifty thousand tons of steel He looked over at his compass And he gazed into its face Needle pointing downward He knew he lost the race In the dark illumination He remembered bygone years He read the Book of Revelation And he filled his cup with tears When the Reaper's task had ended Sixteen hundred had gone to rest The good, the bad, the rich, the poor The loveliest and the best They waited at the landing And they tried to understand But there is no understanding On the judgement of God's hand The news came over the wires And struck with deadly force Love had lost its fires All things had run their course The watchman he lay dreaming Of all the things that can be He dreamed the Titanic was sinking Into the deep blue sea"

blues	O holy night! The stars are brightly shining, It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth. Long lay the world in sin and error pining. Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth. A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices, For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn. Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices! O night divine, the night when Christ was born; O night, O holy night, O night divine! O night, O holy night, O night divine! Led by the light of faith serenely beaming, With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand. O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming, Now come the wise men from out of the Orient land. The King of kings lay thus lowly manger; In all our trials born to be our friends. He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, Behold your King! Before him lowly bend! Behold your King! Before him lowly bend! Truly He taught us to love one another, His law is love and His gospel is peace. Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother. And in his name all oppression shall cease. Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, With all our hearts we praise His holy name. Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we, His power and glory ever more proclaim! His power and glory ever more proclaim!

blues	This hotel bar is full of people, The piano man is really laying it down, The old bartender is as high as a steeple, So why tonight should I wear a frown? The joint is jumpin' all around me, And my mood is really not in style, Right now the blues flock to surround me, But I'll break out after a while. Yes I'm a million miles away, I'm a million miles away, I'm sailing like a driftwood, On a windy bay, On a windy bay. I'm a million miles away, I'm a million miles away, But I'm sailing like a driftwood, On a windy bay, On a windy bay. Why ask how I feel, Well, how does it look to you? I fell hook, line and sinker, Lost my captain and my crew. I'm standing on the landing, There's no one there but me, That's where you'll find me, Looking out on the deep blue sea. There's a song on the lips of everybody, There's a smile all around the room, There's conversation overflowing, But I sit here with the blues. This hotel bar has lost all its people, The piano man has caught the last bus home, The old bartender just collapsed in the corner, Why I'm still here, I just don't know, I don't know. I'm a million miles away, A million miles away, I'm sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay, On a windy bay. I'm a million miles away, A million miles away, I'm sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay, Send me away...

blues	Rain is falling on my head, Pretty soon I might be dead. The end is here, Lord, it's plain to see I guess my country's made a fool of me. If I die, please make sure, Someone will bring me home. If I die, tomorrow, Someone will be all alone. Family's children standin' by, Mother finds it hard not to cry. A look of sadness on their face, Tryin' hard not to show a trace.

blues	White houses in neat little rows, Contrasting against the sky. Tumble down black shacks over the tracks, Children so hungry they could cry. The chrome the steel, the metal dream, Leaving the teeth which will rot. The escapist young mind left behind, Saving dimes for community pot. Better get straight You better, you better get straight, babe I feel, you better get straight right now You better get it You better, you better get straight baby They're crying out for love all the time, But they fail to see the neighbors eyes. The TV is on the six o'clock news, And the channels are full color lies. Company meets, the president speaks, He's young but his bones creak. Young girl dresses for the high school dance And the guy next door is dying for a peek. Get straight, you better, Yeah, you better get straight, baby Oh, did you get what I say? I say it to you That you, you better, You better get it, babe You better, you better get straight, yeah Before it's too late They put the Bible in the drawer of the motel room, And its crying out to be read. But is stays right there collecting dust, No one understands what's being said. Lovers make love in concrete boxes, What will tomorrow bring? They've been told that its wrong but they don't give a damn, Soon another life it will bring You better get straight baby Yeah, you, You better get straight baby Oh and I think I'd better get myself together too, babe You know what I mean? I've been angry so very long I want to fly right here I want to do it all right I want to get it get it baby You better get it, you better get it You better get straight right now Because I've been told And I'm telling you baby Pass it on Its really good advice
blues	If you love me, baby Why don't you write me sometime If you, if you love me, baby Why don't you let me Hear from you sometime You don't do nothing But keep me worried You just keep me worried All the time You know I think about you, baby I think about you Every night about this time Oh you know, you know You know I think about you, baby I think about you Every night about this time It seems like you would treat me A little better, baby It seems like you would be A little nicer and kind Let me love you one more time, baby Let me love you one more time Before you go away Let me, let me love you One more time, baby One more time before you go away If you let me love you one more time I think we can talk it over Before you go away Here I am, baby My heart's right here in my hand Oh here I am, baby My heart's right here in my hand Oh I don't want you to leave me, baby Don't want you to go To no other man
blues	As the mist leaves no scar On the dark green hill So my body leaves no scar On you and never will Through windows in the dark The children come, the children go Like arrows with no targets Like shackles made of snow True love leaves no traces If you and I are one It's lost in our embraces Like stars against the sun As a falling leaf may rest A moment on the air So your head upon my breast So my hand upon your hair And many nights endure Without a moon or star So we will endure When one is gone and far True love leaves no traces If you and I are one It's lost in our embraces Like stars against the sun
blues	Seasons mean nothing You went away and I'm falling Even clouds have tried their best To move and give my tears a rest Seasons mean nothing You went away and I'm falling Even when the cold disarms It still feels like there's something wrong Seasons mean nothing You went away and I'm falling Even when the leaves turn brown In sympathy about the ground
blues	I saw you last night and got that old feeling When you came in sight I got that old feeling The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill And when you caught my eye my heart stood still Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning And I knew the spark of love was still burning There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start For that old feeling, is still in my heart There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start For that old feeling, is still in my heart
blues	Trying to make a train by sunrise gonna have to run a red light Trying to make a train by sunrise gonna have to run a red light Tangling with my Carolina you know the girl kept me up all night And when my Carolina throw down you know the girl knows how to fight Don't think we're gonna make it there's nothing else that anyone can do Don't think we're gonna make it there's nothing else that anyone can say Almost got the feeling that Carolina's liking it that way I'm waiting on the train man, to wait and take the pain away All aboard All aboard All aboard All aboard Wait for me Wait for me Wait for me Wait for me Train man kept his promise gonna try and go on back to bed Train man kept his promise gonna try and go on back to bed Can't sleep anyway thinking 'bout what my Carolina said And oh my Carolina running like a freight train through my head

blues	When first I saw the love light in your eye I dreamt the world had not but joy for me And even though we drifted far apart I never dream, but when I dream of thee I love you as I never loved before Since first I met you on the village green Come to me or my dream of love is over I love you as I loved you When you were sweet When you were sweet sixteen Come to me or my dream of love is over I love you as I loved you When you were sweet When you were sweet sixteen
blues	No right to complain Everything is just alright Everyday's the same Never get caught by surprise I get up 'round nine Have some coffee and a toast And bus number five Is taking me back home Explain it to my heart, my intuition Tells me something fell wide of the mark My common sense tells me nothing's missing I get another message from my heart Longing for a UFO to get me A little green man to take me away I think I need a little science fiction to Lighten up my day I think I need a little science fiction to Lighten up my day Summers come and go Christmas at my sisters house It's strange how things flow No interference without Spending time with you Every day and every night And we'll watch the sky To see when's the next flight Explain it to my heart, my intuition Tells me something fell wide of the mark My common sense tells me nothing's missing I get another message from my heart Longing for a UFO to get me A little green man to take me away I think I need a little science fiction to Lighten up my day I think I need a little science fiction to Lighten up my day I'm tired of reality Where things are so grey and predictable Like to travel through the galaxy To find me a lover from Mars Explain it to my heart
blues	Well, I work hard everyday Come home straight with my pay My baby either drink it up Or she threw it all away I'm gonna quit my baby If she don't stop cheatin' and lyin' Well, I would rather be alone Than to be worried out of my mind Well, I give her all of my money I think I'm being kind She buy a quart of bad whiskey And the rest is beer and wine Well, a few nights ago I had to work kind-a late Somebody broke out of my house Just like he was Superman's mate Well, four o'clock in the morning, when I staggered in the block The little moonshine joint and the rest just begin to rock I sneaked inside to get a better view I caught my baby doin' the mambo too
blues	I caught the last bus down to the harbour Where the moonlight's on the sleeping sea A pretty girl stood there at the bus stop She said hey Johnny come and see about me. She said Doop Doop. So many seamen able and willing Have passed through these arms on their way to the sea They leave me tokens of love and affection When I drank from her lips I tasted the sea. She said Doop Doop. How can a young girl hope to survive Living alone when there's no-one alive Out in the night she swallows her pride And she says catch me Johnny I'm falling again. I jumped a freighter bound for Mombassa I worked every day neath a burning sky l wrote her sea poems and nautical letters I remember her words till the day that I die. She said Doop Doop.

blues	"When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies,"" I cried she was deaf. And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes, Then said, ""What else you got left?"" It was then that I got up to leave But she said, ""Don't forget, Everybody must give something back For something they get."" I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum I asked her how come. And she buttoned her boot, And straightened her suit, Then she said, ""Don't get cute."" So I forced my hands in my pockets And felt with my thumbs, And gallantly handed her My very last piece of gum. She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked. And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked. I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, And I tried to make sense Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair That leaned up against Her Jamaican rum And when she did come, I asked her for some. She said, ""No, dear."" I said, ""Your words aren't clear, You'd better spit out your gum."" She screamed till her face got so red, Then she fell on the floor, And I covered her up and then Thought I'd go look through her drawer. And when I was through I filled up my shoe and brought it to you. And you, you took me in, You loved me then, you never wasted time. And I, I never took much, I never asked for your crutch And I don't ask for mine."
blues	I come from a long line high and low and in between same as you hills of golden hails of poison time's thrown me through and I believe I've come to learn that turnin' round is to become confusion and the gold's no good for spending and the poison's hungry waiting What can you leave behind when you're flyin' lightning fast and all alone? Only a trace, my friend, spirit of motion born and direction grown. A trace that will not fade in frozen skies your journey will be and if her shadow doesn't seem much company who said it would be?

pop	So we meet again after several years several years of separation moving on moving around Did we spend this time chasing the other's tail? Singing Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you Winter and spring Summer and fall You're the wind surfer crossing the ocean and the boat behind Skiffle and rag, shuffle and waltz You're the up tip toe ballerina in the chorus line: Singing Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you River and sea, picking up salt Through the air there's a fluffly cloud falling down as rain Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you - oohooh I could never belong to you -ooh ooh I could never belong to you -ooh ooh

pop	When the mellow moon begins to beam, Ev'ry night I dream a little dream, And of course Prince Charming is the theme, The he for me. Although I realize as well as you It is seldom that a dream comes true, For me it's clear That he'll appear. Some day he'll come along, The man I love And he'll be big and strong, The man I love And when he comes my way I'll do my best to make him stay. He'll look at me and smile I'll understand, And in a little while, He'll take my hand, And though it seems absurd, I know we both won't say a word Maybe I shall meet him Sunday Maybe Monday, maybe not Still I'm sure to meet him one day Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day He'll build a little home Just meant for two, From which I'll never roam, Who would, would you? And so all else above I'm waiting for the man I love.
pop	Quand le soleil se pointe à l´horizon Tes griffes sont rentrées et tu ronronnes dans mon cou Des petits mots chauffés à blanc comme ta robe Des petits mots tabous des mots qu´on n´écrit pas sur une invitation Quand le soleil entre dans ma maison-on Quand le soleil se pointe à l´horizon Tu promènes endormie tes lèvres douces sur mes reins Je sens tes seins dressés comme des barricades Et sur ma peau tes dents qui brodent des croissants Bleutés comme tes cernes Quand le soleil entre dans ma maison-on Quand le soleil se pointe à l´horizon Tu m´égratignes le cœur avec tes épingles à cheveux Et tu dis en baillant chéri fais-moi l´amour Fous ce réveil en l´air et fais-moi du café Brûlant comme ta bouche Quand le soleil entre dans ma maison-on
pop	A time for memories returning, A time for heartache and yearning, Shades of blue, crowding through, as I sit here remembering you. A time for wondering what happened, for wondering why did it happen. No goodbye, not a sigh, How could love slip away and just dye. I thought that you, the night, the summertime were out of sight and out of mind. Yet here you are the night, the summertime still in my heart, I was blind. A time for memories returning, with too much heartache and yearning, so I better store these dreams away, Like broken toys in the attic the memories of my yesterdays
pop	La, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la There's a creepy little house in a creepy little place Little creepy town in a little creepy world Little creepy girl with her little creepy face Saying funny things you have never heard Do you know what it's all about Are you brave enough to figure out Know that you could set your world on fire If you are strong enough to leave your doubts Feel it, breathe it, believe it And you'll be walking on air Go try, go fly, so high And you'll be walking on air She has a creepy little cat and a creepy little bat Little rocking chair and an old blue hat That little creepy girl, oh she loves to sing She has a little gift, an amazing thing With her funny little eyes of hazel With her funny old blue hat She will go and set the world on fire No one ever thought she could do that Feel it, breathe it, believe it And you'll be walking on air Go try, go fly, so high And you'll be walking on air Feel this, unless you kill it Go on, and you're forgiven I knew that, I could feel that I feel like, I am walking on air Flitter up, and Hover down, be All around, be All around You know that I love you Go on Feel it, breathe it, believe it And you'll be walking on air I knew that and I could feel that I feel like, I'm walking on air I'm walking on air
pop	Every time I wear this shirt I think of you. All the dreams I have are always dreamt in blue Every place I find myself I've been there with you Abandoned loneliness I ask why, why, why? [Chorus] Why did you crucify me? Strung up for your love Was I so blind to see? Pushed aside, sterilized, crucified. Looking back I see my faults, was I so wring To lock you up inside my arms? I thought I was being strong. Now I see you built the walls that keep me in You turned my world around, and still I cry, cry, cry. [Chorus] Brutalized, immortalized, crucified. Abandoned loneliness You turned my world around, Words were never said...
pop	Baby, you ain't a man 'Cause my heart's carried in Your hand. Any fool can see, I love my misery. Bad news It's born in my blood Bad news Some live to undo, some live to be undone My grey sky's growing dark I feed on my own heart. Bad news It's born in my blood Bad news Whisper's what you done, Crazy I've bought a gun My finger's to your window, Whiskey's on my clothes I'm bad news It's born in my blood. Bad news. It's born in my blood.
pop	High above the tallest tree Courage will come your way It's the need that burns the trust that shines When you climb out of the shade Your high awakes the things you wanna be Where the air is thin and sweeps you off your feet Where the heart is When the light's at your side When the faith is ready No more guidance Take the leap of your life As the ground is shaking Shaking off your troubled soul As silence seems to grow It's the faith in sight, the doubt that fades As the world dissolves below Your high awakes the things you wanna be Where the air is thin and sweeps you off your feet Where the heart is When the light's at your side When the faith is ready No more guidance Take the leap of your life As the ground is shaking You are falling to the stars, you are falling And you are falling to the stars, you are falling You are falling to the stars, you are falling And you are falling to the stars, you are falling Where the heart is When the light's at your side When the faith is ready No more guidance Take the leap of your life As the ground is shaking
pop	There's nothing in the world that I'd like more Than to be left standing outside your door Where perhaps I might be, asked to come in There I could very easily demonstrate What now appears to be my fate You see I'm hooked on something And it's not heroin Oh, I just can't get enough of you No I can't get enough, what am, I gonna do I've tried every trick in the book that's going Now I've decided that they're not worth knowing My predicament is as simple as this I'm not satisfied and the reason is I just can't get enough of you My experience of life so far Has been to say the least not the least bizarre I mean I work for a living, 8 hours a day I don't smoke or drink except for a little wine The friends that I have are the genuine kind I think I'm fairly rational in a moderate way Yet I can't get enough of you No I can't get enough, what am I gonna do I've had other woman but they don't move me You're the only one that can see right through me What you've got I can't explain Other than to tell you I have one complaint I just can't get enough of you I just can't get enough of you No I can't get enough, what am I gonna do Like Oliver Twist, said when he asked for more I happen to like what you gave me before My condition is rather unique I'm suffering from the world's first lovely disease I just can't get enough of you
pop	Smoked my last cigarette Took a look at the bed The one that we called home Bought a ticket to somewhere, anywhere Did you think of me blind? 'Cause I walked in circles I know you thought of me unkind But I tried to lead you through the minefield Instead I led you to another Pack my bags, walking in rain Here them voices inside my head Drinking that booze and taking down names And plates and seeing the place where I dream Call my name, shout my name Try to consume the place where I lay Driving on the freeway passing up cars Crashed my car, gotta get out of here Had to rip up my heart, had to patch up my head At the hotel terrace Had a drink at the bar, stumbled up and away Every piss and a girl is a ghost of you Did you think of me blind? 'Cause I fly around in circles I know you think of me unwise But I try to lead you through the minefield Instead I lead you to another Pack my bags, walking in rain Here them voices inside my head Drinking that booze and taking down names And plates and seeing the place where I dream Call my name, shout my name Try to consume the place where I lay Driving on the freeway, passing up cars Crashed my car, gotta get out of here When you realized me blind You lead me round in circles For seven years I read your lies But still I lead you through that minefield Find my way back through another Pack my bags, walking in rain Here them voices inside my head Drinking that booze and taking down names And plates and seeing that place where I dream Call my name, shout my name Try to consume the place where I lay Driving on the freeway, passing up cars Crashed my car, gotta get out of here Pack my bags, walking in rain (Did you think of me blind?) Here them voices inside my head Drinking that booze and taking down names ('Cause still I fly around in circles) And plates and seeing that place where I dream (Did you think of me blind?) Try to consume the people I pay Flying on the freeway light speed ship, rocket ship ('Cause still I fly around in mind fields) Trying to get out of here
pop	I missed the opportunity To get you babe to stay with me. Never thought, I'd regret the excuses that I've made Like a song, it will fade If there's music in the night, And it's really, really right, It's the only thing I need. It intoxicates your mind All your troubles left behind So come on and take my lead. It's not just me who feels it Music plays a mind trick Watch me forget about missing you So I put my feelings out to dry Love, one day again, I'll have to try. Falling out, making up It seems such a silly game Why do I never gain? If there's music in the night, And it's really, really right, It's the only thing I need. It intoxicates your mind All your troubles left behind So come on and take my lead. It's not just me who feels it Music plays a mind trick Watch me forget about missing you Na na na's If there's music in the night, And it's really, really right, It's the only thing I need. It intoxicates your mind All your troubles left behind So come on and take my lead. It's not just me who feels it Music plays a mind trick Watch me forget about missing you

And the poets studied rows of verse, And all the ladies rolled their eyes Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane Now, Jack, he is a banker, And Jane, she is a clerk. And the both of them are saving up their money... Then they come home from work. Sittin' by the fire... Radio just played a little classical music for you kids, The march of the wooden soldiers And you can hear Jack say Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane Some people like to go out dancing And other people, (like us) they gotta work And there's always some evil mothers They'll tell you life is full of dirt. And the women never really faint, And the villans always blink their eyes. And the children are the only ones who blush. 'Cause life is just to die. But, anyone who has a heart Wouldn't want to turn around and break it And anyone who ever played the part He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it Sweet Jane

He likes the night life, The bright lights, and good-timin' friends. When the party's all over, She'll welcome him back home again. Lord knows she don't understand him, But she does the best that she can. 'Cause she's a good-hearted woman; She loves her good-timin' man. She's a good-hearted woman In love with a good-timin' man.

Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down But then most of all, I do love you Still We played the games that people play We made our mistakes along the way Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me 'Cause I needed you so desperately We were too blind to see, but then Most of all, I do love you Still

Where were you at the hint of success? When through the window of opportunity came The glimmer of a day in the sun Glimmer of a day in the sun You took the canvas of a life Torn with the wind and the loss could still pull you along Pocketing images one by one Of the past, toward your future, ""A penny for your song"" Position memories carefully You dust them off at holidays Then you'll go back to the board room And declare your passion for the new day But where were you at the bleakest of moments? Where were you at the hint of success? When through the window of opportunity came The glimmer of a day in the sun Glimmer of a day in the sun I don't think that it's me you've got in mind Looks like the blind still bluffing the blind Lead me on and lay me down 'Cause where were you? Where were you at the bleakest of moments? Where were you at the hint of success? When through the window of opportunity came The glimmer of a day in the sun Glimmer of a day in the sun"

Where troubles melt like lemon drops, High above the chimney tops. That's where you'll find me. Somewhere over the rainbow, Bluebirds fly. They fly over the rainbow, Why then - oh, why can't I? I see trees of green, red roses too. I watch them bloom for me and you. And I think to myself, What a wonderful world. Well, I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white. The brightness of day and light, darkness of night. And I think to myself, What a wonderful world. The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky, Are also on the faces of people passin' by. I see friends shakin' hands, saying ""How do you do!"" They're really sayin' ""I love you."" I hear babies cry and I watch them grow. They'll learn much more than I'll ever know.

Come on can you hear me in the back If you can't let 'em know and we'll turn up the track So come on An enemy voice is an enemy mind And I'm just not sure if I'm wasting your time If I could see the inertia I'd give it a try But I gotta project or I gotta deny Nothing is wrong oh, but something ain't right I don't feel this; I'm not seeing this Something ain't coming unless I've got a feeling Don't make a sound; keep your eyes on the ceiling It's automatic; I know we used to have it And I wanted to let it go; I wish it would make it so Nothing's gonna save me when the chips are down Nothing's gonna save you if you don't act now But the current event is like a curdling sound The event hypothetical is better than now The action on the trigger's just to stay in your mind Any action or reaction is just a matter of time Now the people on the left let me see your faith I want to start it off slow then we'll pick up the pace And now the people on the right ain't no time to waste Been a long time coming gonna hit the ground running Now the people in the crowd let me see those hands 'Cause it's so far gone I'm not surprised no one understands What! Turn it up can you hear me in the back Fly now so we testify so we can never die Fly now so we testify so we can never die So we fly So we all pretend we're oblivious Perfectly serious Tell me that you needed this Never know what you're gonna find Never know what you might have left undefined But I can tell you what it won?t be Another web of confusions Of lies and illusions You can't imagine the half of them Petrified Genocide Masterminds Worlds that they've undermined It's a place it's a time it's a lifeline It's a chance to atone for a lifetime Reach your hands to the sky when you testify Put 'em up keep 'em up until you realize Killing them once is like killing them twice Killing with something that's a killing device It's killing them slowly then it's killing them nice If it's killing your act I want a reich Now the people on the left let me hear you say That you're sick of their lies and you're not gonna take And now the people on the right ain't no time to waste Gonna start it off slow bring it on now bring it Now the people in the crowd let me see those hands up Stand up and demand some answers What! Come on can you hear me in the back If you can't let 'em know and we'll turn up the track So come on Now the people on the left let me see your faith I want to start it off slow then we'll pick up the pace And now the people on the right ain't no time to waste Been a long time coming gonna hit the ground running Now the people in the crowd let me see those hands 'Cause it's so far gone I'm not surprised no one understands What!

Ja Mach nur einen Schritt hier rein und du verlierst dich Das Dunkel frisst einen auf, wenn du nicht von hier bist Warum mach' ich kaputt, was ich so liebe? Der Schatten wächst, frisst alle deine Gefühle (auf, auf) Ich hasse den Mensch auf's Blut, doch würde für manche sterben Meine Scheiß Vergangenheit war ein Haufen Scherben Mir geht es viel besser als damals viel, viel besser Doch ganz ehrlich ein kleines bisschen vermiss' ich die Schmerzen So Bock auf ein ruhiges Leben, doch bin immer in Action Ich renne, so schnell meine Beine mich lassen, doch müsste mich nur mal kurz setzen Scheiß' so krass auf rappen, doch bin davon besessen Bin nie wirklich satt, weil der Kuchen zu klein ist, doch trotzdem teil' ich mein Fressen Tausende Wege hier raus, sich quälen macht doch keinen Sinn Doch ich geh' noch tiefer rein, bis ich komplett verloren bin Verstehe mich selber nicht was mach' ich hier drin? Macht der Gewohnheit mein Zuhaus ein Labyrinth! Andere Regeln, anderes Leben Teile nicht deine Werte, immer noch dagegen Du hast kein' Platz hier drin, in diesem Labyrinth Willkommen in meinem Kopf, in meinem Kopf! Schattenwelt, ein schwarzes Loch Schizophren, doch funktioniere noch Du hast kein' Platz hier drin, in diesem Labyrinth Willkommen in meinem Kopf, in meinem Kopf! Schattenwelt in meinem Kopf Schizophren in meinem Kopf Schwarzes Loch in meinem Kopf Labyrinth, Laby-, Laby-, Labyrinth Jeden Tag immer neue Gesichter Tausend Spiegelbilder teilen sich ein Schicksal Eine Gefahr für die Umwelt, nicht mal vor mir selber sicher Der schmale Grat zwischen Gut und Böse unauffindbar Rede mit mir selber, doch ich hör' nicht zu Die Stimmen schreien nach Hilfe, aber es geht mir gut So kurz vor dem Burnout, in meinen Adern klumpt das Blut Müsste runterkommen, doch werde krank, wenn ich nichts tu' Fast kein Weg hier raus, die Augen weit auf, auch wenn es Nacht wird Und in dieser Einzelzelle öffnet das Fenster Zum Hof oft nur dann, wenn mein Stift auf das Blatt trifft Behalt' dein Mitleid, denn es macht nix, ich komm' schon klar Alle meine Worte? sehen sie nicht, denn sie sind blind Vielleicht geht's mir besser, weil ich hier gefangen bin Verstehe mich selber nicht was mach' ich hier drin? Macht der Gewohnheit mein Zuhaus ein Labyrinth! Andere Regeln, anderes Leben Teile nicht deine Werte, immer noch dagegen Du hast kein' Platz hier drin, in diesem Labyrinth Willkommen in meinem Kopf, in meinem Kopf! Schattenwelt, ein schwarzes Loch Schizophren, doch funktioniere noch Du hast kein' Platz hier drin, in diesem Labyrinth Willkommen in meinem Kopf, in meinem Kopf!

Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner ""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough"" But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!"" Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave. Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block (Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!) I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete I picked him up, then I held him by his head His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was Aw man! How do I say goodbye? It's always the good ones who have to die Memories in the corner of my mind Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time I taught him, all about the bees and birds But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words After laughter, comes tears Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex He seemed to ignore, I said be for real She's not even worth it, to go raw deal A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do He got butt-naked and stuck the power you Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story But he carried on, with the same old stuff with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck Both tried to be down with O.P.P. Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now No life to live, doc says two more years So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears After laughter, comes tears After laughter, comes tears"

But Quote Unqoute, that's the way it goes. I'm looking at the picture again. I'm looking at the picture again. I spin the sundial to expectation, twenty years ago I saw you yesterday. You're looking at the picture. I see you looking at the picture now And for the slightest moment I watched you think about what it's like as a paper doll. [Chorus] One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll, (paper doll), paper doll One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll, (paper doll), oh, paper doll. Imagine yourself as a cloud in the sky. You pass me by and I blow you a kiss. A thinking cloud, so you're wondering why, only to find out it doesn't exist. Life surrounds what's presumed as wise. It wouldn't be wise until the fist uncurls. No one I don't know ever stands in my eyes. Because of the quote unquote, real world. I'm thinking about yesterday. I'm actually thinking about yesterday. A thousand words say it doesn't exist. A thousand ideas tell me otherwise. You're thinking about yesterday. I know you're thinking about yesterday but For the slightest moment I watched you think about what it's like as a paper doll. [Chorus] Regardless of how you think, regardless of how you feel, see yourself as, More than a human being. It's recognizable, spiritually and mentally. Hold my hands forever, paper doll. [Chorus]"

rap	Hey du, hey du, Hör mir ma, hör mir ma zu. Ick will dir ma, wat erzählen von mir, Det hab ick noch nie jemacht, außer bei dir. Vielleicht bringt et dir wat, Ick kenn dir ja nich, Ick seh nur wie traurig du bist. Nein mein Freund, das Leben singt keine Kinderlieder, Verdammt es ist hart du musst was tun das sag ich immer wieder Und nicht das du denkst der labert nur , ich weiß wovon ich rede. Schließlich rap' ich mir mit jedem Song die Scheiße von der Seele. Pass auf ich erzähl' dir was, damit du nicht mehr traurig bist. Etwas das für dich bestimmt wirklich ziemlich unglaublich ist. Ich bin im Osten aufgewachsen, ja du hörst richtig. Doch das es da 'ne Mauer gab interessierte mich nicht. Ich war ein stolzer Pionier obwohl eingesperrt wie ein Tier. Mama sagte das die Nachbarn heimlich bei uns spionieren. Und weil sie uns wohl überwachten, wollte sie schnell rüber machen. Sachen Packen, Kinder an die Hände flüchten über Nacht. Und da nisteten wir uns provisorisch bei verwandten ein. Doch nicht lange,denn da gab's 'nen platz im Asylantenheim. Mitten in Wedding zwischen Apatschen und Alkis. Und mit den neuen Homies kletterte ich nachts in den Aldi. Denn ein Ostler Junge war nicht wirklich angesagt im Westen. Ich bekam wegen der Herkunft was jeden Tag auf die Fresse. Und ab da hab ich mir geschworen ein Geheimnis draus zu machen. Damit meine Kumpels kein Grund haben mich auszulachen. Warum ich dir das jetzt erzähle weiß ich nicht genau. Wahrscheinlich weil du grad so guckst mit deinen weinerlichen Augen. Doch ich glaub unter dem Wasser steckt 'ne Fratze die sich sehen lässt. Ich hoffe dieses Lied wischt deine Tränen weg, hör zu. Hey du, hey du, Hör mir ma, hör mir ma zu. Ick will dir ma, wat erzählen von mir, Det hab ick noch nie jemacht,außer bei dir. Vielleicht bringt et dir wat, Ick kenn' dir ja nich, Ick seh' nur wie traurig du bist Dann sind wir ins MV gezogen, ein Viertel am Stadtrand. Und ab dann ging's ab man, nicht mal ein Haar am Sack dran. Aber Faxen machen, denn Mama fehlte es am Geld. Also hab ich gelernt wie man's anstellt,auf der Straße. Die Schule war natürlich nur noch reine Nebensache. Man wird einfach ins Leben entlassen nach der zehnten Klasse. Und dann stand ich da, ohne alles wiedermal. Mama machte mir noch 'ne Ausbildung als Erzieher klar. Doch auch da bin ich rausgeflogen und zu Hause ausgezogen. Ohne Wohnung nur bei Bo die Luftmatratze auf dem Boden. Keine Perspektive, keine Aussicht auf was besseres. Nur ganz viel von dem Zeug das dich vergessen lässt, zu viel. Ich weiß ich kenn' dich nicht, doch ich erzähl dir das. Damit du weißt wie viele Fassetten das Leben hat. Ich mein mal geht es abwärts doch dann lernst du aus deiner Pleite. Und dann geht es hoch guck hier das Schicksal war auf meiner Seite. Das macht es auch für dich,das wird schon wieder glaub an dich. Die Zukunft zaubert dir wie mir ein breites grinsen aufs Gesicht. Lauf nicht einfach hin und her, sieh's positiv das ist nicht schwer. Ich hatte diesen Traum ich hab ihn verfolgt und jetzt bin ich wer. Warum ich dir das jetzt erzähle weiß ich nicht genau. Wahrscheinlich weil du grad so guckst mit deinen weinerlichen Augen. Doch ich glaub unter dem Wasser steckt 'ne Fratze die sich sehen lässt. Ich hoffe dieses Lied wischt deine Tränen weg, hör zu. Hey du, hey du, Hör mir ma, hör mir ma zu. Ick will dir ma, wat erzählen von mir, Det hab ick noch nie jemacht,außer bei dir. Vielleicht bringt et dir wat, Ick kenn' dir ja nich, Ick seh' nur wie traurig du bist

Bring it home Keith! They took the long great line that was so fine Super and strong to play, three games a day Hey hey, Thunder Twins are up and gonna win again Make the other players say ""Oh him again!"" But whattya know? Black baseball (baseball) they paved the way With players like Dandy, the Devil, and Day Black baseball (baseball) Black baseball (baseball) Black baseball (baseball) Poppa Bell was Cool, broke any catcher's rule On the base, at night, total speed rip the light Comin' past flick flash he was so fast Scouts watchin' in awe at what they saw The best in the game, it's a shame, you don't know Alex and Double Duty, and don't forget Juty Talent was there, and it was black Give them their credit folks, and build em a hall of fame Where legends can rest, with uniforms and the whole shebang And honor the players, coaches fans and the ballparks From the Giants or Phillies, to the New York like Yankees The Pittsburgh Crawfords, yeah they don't have to thank me Just thank the Red Bull's, just thank the Abe Manley's Just thank Rufus Lewis, a few names that grab me Black baseball (baseball) they paved the way With players like Dandy, the Devil, and Day Black baseball (baseball) Black baseball (baseball) Black baseball (baseball) Black baseball (baseball) And we're out And we're gone"

rap	Chaque jour je remercie le ciel toujours conscient de mon privilège D’aller sur un chemin qui me tient loin de tout piège Chouette balade l’incertitude douce compagne je ai fuis ses grises comptées dans l’ennui et le bagne Et le bourreau à maintes reprises que je veux la même chose que les autres Que je ai pas à en avoir honte je aspire au calme dans mon cœur dans ma tête et ma corde Sachant que dans mon jardin secret comme tous je ai des roses et des ronces Poings sérés je fais des choix c’est seul que je rendrai mes comptes Aucun regret à tire postule je me tiens et je assume Cette voie sinueuse où chaque mot est doux comme une larme et dur comme une plume Longtemps je ai du aiguiser couper les fils de mes membres Mes doutes, je ai du les terrasser, avant que ce n’ soit eux qui m’étendent Le but de ma lutte, avoir droit de choisir aussi longtemps que possible Et si le bonheur vient en prime je pense pas qu’ ça puisse être nuisible Je sais que banale est ma quête à l’inverse de mon procédé Les bras tendus dans le noir je ère, en fait tout c’ que je peux faire c’est Avancer sans vraiment savoir si mon ciel sera bleu ou gris Si il fera jour ou nuit dans les couloirs de ma vie Tant pis si le temps fuis je sais seulement c’ que je suis Et le reste n’est qu’un grand pari je aimerai bien savoir ce que la vie me réserve Pour l’instant, je fais comme tous, je vis sur mes réserves Le nez pointé sur mes feuilles mais ma tête je sais pas où Comme si je étais d’ailleurs et pourtant les pieds bien sur terre ou Où on veut tout planifier bien sûr sans penser au destin Le facteur qui fait que tu trouves ta voie dans ton chemin L’incertitude mais même depuis le début faire mon jackpot Mais ça tu gagnes sec à part moi et mes potes Unis comme les doigts de la main Unis contre le mauvais sort pour le bien Unis pour que chacun soit plus que bien Après ce qui arrive on suit l’arrivée on relativise On relate c’ que tu vises et on se sert les coudes Le tout est d’ mettre un sac pour sa volonté Voilà pourquoi vos tympans on continue à les violenter Avec ce son qui sort de mes tripes je ferai de balade une sale vibe après c’ qui y’a autour je en sais rien Avancer sans vraiment savoir si mon ciel sera bleu ou gris Si ce que je suis était écris je m’ennuie tant mieux si le temps suit Conscient que rien n’est acquit Chaque jour je me donne un sursis Qui peut dire quand mon cœur cessera de battre Quand ma langue sera vaine à mes sens Nous pouvons plus donner d’images à mes rêves Murmures sur mes lèvres Ces airs que je aimais chanter Cette armée de quatrains que je ai enfanté Un soir de mai la désillusion a frappé plus fort que je peux l’encaisser Elle a brisé mes vertèbres je ai eu si mal, mon cœur triste en témoigne Les séquelles s’éloignent Et je reste là comme un chien dans la plaine On me pointe de l’index alors que je pousse le majeur en retour La variété voudrai me passer l’annulaire Mais je ai toujours un seize en recours extra curiculaire je suis verbalisé infiltré derrière mes auriculaires Ils poussent l’avenir au bûcher le temps de vouloir me voir réussir Puis tournent le pied pour me faire trébucher Esprit complexe, rime complexe, décris mon texte Demain c’est moi encore plus vrai dans le souci complexe Avancer sans vraiment savoir si mon ciel sera bleu ou gris Même si je n’ai pas de garantie je choisis tant mieux si le vent suis Conscient que rien n’est acquis Je rejoue ma vie à l’infini Où va la vie? Qu’est-ce que je en sais?

rap	Into a world I plunge through my headphones Escape into the streetlight I begin to believe in destiny When my surroundings in rhythm with me I'm just a grain of sand walking in a sea of people I look around me and my name is just someone For a moment in time I belong Where my heart beats the fear is gone Like destiny So move with me I'm strong enough To be weak in your arms Move with me I'm strong enough To be real in your arms Whispering as I was driving Quietly the car was rolling Like a bullet I was feeling the speed moving Me faster. Addicted to the rhythm On my ghetto blaster That's me supposing That the clarity of thought Is clear enough to think It's real enough to touch The wind on me got me tripping Can I keep you next to me Till the end of the world So move with me I'm strong enough To be weak in your arms Move with me I'm strong enough To be real in your arms So move with me I'm strong enough To be weak in your arms Move with me I'm strong enough To be real in your arms Like the joker on the pile Never coming or going The colour of my true cards was showing Keeping in touch with an idea That I been growing Trust trust I must trust With my head on my chest I rest with the rest of the restless So move with me I'm strong enough To be weak in your arms Move with me I'm strong enough To be real in your arms

rap	All the places and spaces I've been All the places and spaces I've been All the places and spaces I've been All the places and spaces I've been Welcome to the zone where the strong only survive Places I drive all the gangsters can't stay alive Take my universal journey through the jungles of the hardest town Where my brothers lay their life down You want something to play with? Go find some toys when you mistake these grown men for little boys More real than what is real so feel I'm sending Compare the God with no beginning and we'll have no ending My blessed rings are down with the kings revalation Had heard me on the run-dmc's reincarnation Child abuse, women loose, robbery and triple homicide Every where this black man resides still Check the monolouge, I'm on a 6 a.m. jog To regain my powers, do a set before the showers I'm prime for the summertime, the big time bowler But any season or reason we can't take it over All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Known to be the smooth that sat by the door Furthermore, for you and I to click, here's the stats Take all that dirty money, set the wash doors and laundromats You love to gamble now we open an after-hours spot 20 Sacks with the guiness for the jackpot Members only, playing pool like willie marconi With a tenderoni chatting about the gs I'm batting I'm patting down with the sound of a general Fully supplied by my ghettofied residential We come to rebuild and turn off the heat now Hoping we can take it back to yugenot street Palled around the screen tv watching the fight Tonight, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right Ink tents in all of my circumference I connect Now demanding all types of respect, can you dig it? All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it? All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it? All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it? All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it? All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it? All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it? Traveling the warp speed we come to the peak Like a missle I probe and seek, many can't critique My physique is still solid, chiseled down to the very last compound I'm trying that chin, fool, where you been? Still sliding girls in as soon as pops fall asleep His game tight, set to flip a shorty late night I like rocks and groupies, condo shows and cuties The hottest cars and the strongest drinks at the bars This is one of those joints that make you stand by the exits Cause every time I'm yapping something crazy happens Keep my tool in my baggy jeans rolling with sneaker feet Who got a life term working for the firm My labor's fruit off of business as usual Plus my two clan band is making me a wealthy man Now from where I stand, believe it's not a game Pete rock and c.l. smooth's a household name All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it? All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it? All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it? All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it? All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it? All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Drop wie X, glauben, dass sie Hip Hop lieben. Manche glauben, die Twin Towers zu zerstören war schlimm, Doch hört erst hin, Wie die meisten deutschen Rap-Acts klingen. Ich bring mit drei Namen gleichzeitig, drei LP’s, Höre dreimal, ich wär' viel zu tight für’s Game. Ich fick zehn Crew mit zehn Lines an einem Mic, Hör zehnmal ich wär' für das Game zu tight. Geh und schreib hundert Raps, mich wundert es, Warum wird E-K-O’s Megaflow unterschätzt? Lad' mein Album runter, lass mich nichts verdienen, Doch ich bin trotzdem immer besser als ihr Bitch-MC’s. Komm her, wenn du unsere Flows und Texte liebst. Optik, Der Rest ist mies, Rest in Peace! Versucht es zu verstehen, Wir sind zu true für’s Game. Optik, alle anderen Crews sind fake. Ihr macht’s euch zu bequem Und habt noch Groups und Pain. Alle anderen Dudes sind fake. Versucht es zu verstehen, Wir sind zu true für’s Game. Optik, alle anderen Crews sind fake. Ihr macht’s euch zu bequem Und habt noch Groups und Pain. Alle anderen Dudes sind Fake.

rap	"Alors les petits? Quoi de neuf depuis la dernière fois? Vous vous sentez prêts c'est ça? Vous n'avez plus, le trac? C'est l'histoire de deux frères, qui écrivent dans leurs chambres Qui sont tombés dans l'rap par hasard et qui tentent leur chance Qui sentent les rouages qui s'enclenchent, les anciens rois qui flanchent Il est grand temps que les temps changent c'est l'moment Sèche tes larmes et prépare ta lame, viens avec nous Mets-toi dans l'coup, viens rallumer la flamme Pour nous c'est plus que du rap, c'est toute notre vie C'est plus que des fans, c'est toute notre ville C'est pas une question d'âge, pas une question d'couleur Pas une question d'race, de poids ou de physique Mais c'est une question d'âme, c'est une question d'douleur C'est une question de rage, d'foi et de musique Et peut-être bien qu'on s'trompe, qu'c'est nous les cons, mais viens on va s'lancer Et puis si on aura pas changé le monde, on moins nous on aura changé P't-être qu'on s'prend pour c'qu'on n'est pas, qu'on n'est pas encore prêts On est devant la grande porte, a-t-on choisi la bonne clé? Balance le beat que j'rappe, que j'claque, que j'frappe, que j'montre qu'on a la dalle Qu'on en a marre de ces types qui ne disent rien devant le mic' Qui nous prennent de haut, qui nous rabaissent, qui s'moquent, qui nous mentent Qui changent de discours selon le produit qu'ils nous vendent Ils font du rap comme ils pourraient faire du sport Moi j'fais jamais de sport, car j'passe mon temps à faire du rap J'veux l'vivre à en crever, Oli m'a dit d'viser très haut Alors on a taffé, gratté pour des (yeah yeah yo) Le vent tourne comme la roue Je n'tends plus la joue, franchement faut qu'j't'avoue J'ai peur, souvent les gens m'poussent à bout J'me sens plus jaloux, y'a rien d'plus tabou qu'le cœur Traverser le miroir, je rêve de les rejoindre Aide-nous à leur dire qu'on a faim, qu'on est pleins, qu'ils peuvent nous craindre Nous on n'a pas une vie de voyous, pas une tête de durs Donc on fera pas rêver les petits bourges en manque d'aventures Décidément j'ai du mal à me faire à l'idée que la fin déboule, faut que tu saches J'entends des voix dans mon lit, seul la nuit qui me disent ""Biggy nan faut pas que tu lâches"" Je donnerai de mon temps, de ma voix et des milliers de lignes, des millions de phrases Et puis je les entends qui débitent des conneries à longueur de temps, ils ont pas passé l'âge Ils font semblant d'pas nous entendre, semblant de pas nous voir Mais les petits ont grandi dans l'noir, on vient prendre le pouvoir Depuis longtemps, on attend, chaque jour on apprend On veut rentrer dans la cour des grands La cour des grands, c'est ça Mais pour qui vous vous prenez? Vous n'avez encore rien fait, rien accompli Et toi Oli, tu as quelques chose à leur dire? Le soleil va s'lever, ici tout est plus calme Dans mon cocon familial, loin des paillettes de la capitale La même chambre d'enfant, sans rideau ni coulisses Les posters nous observent et reflètent nos fous rires Venez on rappe la vraie vie, et tout c'qui nous ressemble J'vais l'crier fort pour ceux qui sont partis qu'ils puissent aussi m'entendre Fini de faire les cons, prenez ce son comme un attentat On m'dit ""assure, hein, fais du bon, ça fait trop longtemps qu'on attend ça"" Des heures pour une photo, des lettres qu'ils n'ont pas lues J'étais comme un visiteur de musée qui parlait aux statues Fan de rap, devant la glace j'ai chialé trop d'textes Donc venez débrancher mon micro si un jour j'prends la grosse tête Et j'y crois, comme un fou qu'attend l'retour d'sa femme J'ai pas l'choix, on va l'faire au moins pour les deux-trois fans La chance on va la prendre, tu vas entendre nos voix Ceux qui n'ont pas donné d'coup d'pouce vont s'en mordre les doigts Demain c'est nous, la barre est haute qui peut la décrocher? Sur un tas de projets, on va tous les faucher Avec ou sans trophée, la vie on va croquer Ça fait trop longtemps qu'on veut l'faire Car cet album sera la trace de notre passage sur Terre Ils seraient capables de nous vendre du silence Une salle vide face à un grand pianiste, un zénith plein pour un rappeur qui ment Les graines de stars se plantent, le succès n'est qu'illusoire Car même en haut d'l'affiche il faut redescendre pour la voir On a besoin de vous, c'est le départ d'une nouvelle ère, la plupart de nos pas, on les fait entre frères On peut pas s'planter y'aura jamais de plan B, faut r'monter la pente après, sinon, on va s'planter Depuis tout petits la musique nous suit, on a faim tiens toi bien on va changer les règles Monte le son dans ton casque ils entendent que mon rap on veut lire notre rêve sur le bord de tes lèvres À deux, on est plus forts et avec vous, plus encore On est parés, on va jeter un pavé dans l'eau qui dort Depuis longtemps, on attend, chaque jour on apprend On veut rentrer dans la cour des grands Mais le chemin sera long Et il reste encore beaucoup de marches à gravir Bonne chance Quant à nous, on se reverra c'est sûr"

rap	Have you ever in your life experienced a day Where nothing at all seems to go your way No matter how hard you try to get out of the rut You just could not break the string of bad luck A day where Murphy's law takes over your life And you just can't seem to do a darn thing right And when the day was over you just had to say You said man it's just one of those days My day started off kind of cool I brushed my teeth I combed my hair and I got dressed and went to school I stopped at the store for a breakfast snack A tasty cake and orange juice and a bubble yum pack About that point I proceeded to class I spoke to all the pretty girls that I passed I went to my room which was on the first floor I had no idea what I was in for I sat in my desk and minded my own business Someone knocked on the door the teacher said who is it This girl walked in my imagination ran wild She stole my heart just by the way that she smiled I couldn't resist so I grabbed her butt She said what's wrong with you fool are you some kind of nut The teacher turned around while my arm was extended She looked me in the face and said Prince you're suspended I said your tripping it's just a bad habit She put it in my face she must've wanted me to grab it I pleaded my case but she wrote the pink slip Then I just shook my head I said I don't believe this She sent me to the head of the discipline staff I tried to play it off so I started to laugh I said ha ha this story is great It's a big misunderstanding one big mistake He didn't think that it was funny he didn't even smile He said hm-hm-hm you're an unlucky child I stopped laughing and I said why is that He said just get out my school and don't you ever come back I said wait this is my school and you're telling me to leave it He handed me my books and said yep you'd best believe it As I walked out the school back at the wall I did gaze And said man it's just one of those days I woke up around a quarter to eight I wiped the sleep from out my eyes and I was feeling great I flipped my radio on and to my utter surprise I thought that it was eight o'clock but it was half past nine I hopped up and put my feet on the floor Ran to the bathroom then I (ow) hit my foot on the door The pain was immense as it started to throb I said to hell with broken toes I was losing my job So I combed my hair then I brushed my teeth Threw on my Fila suit and my Fila sneaks Threw on my Fila underwear and my Fila hat Then I ran downstairs and kicked the fila cat I grabbed my jacket then I grabbed my keys Then I prayed out loud car start please The car started but what good was that I couldn't drive it anyway because the tires were flat I did the hundred yard dash to the top of my block Then I grabbed a dollar bill from my left sweat sock The bus pulled up I was late and kind of nervous I got real mad because the sign said out of service I started hiking it I wasn't liking it I saw a little kid I stole his bike and started biking it I thought I got away but when I ducked around the corner There was twelve cop cars I said I'm a goner Slammed on the flat I did 180 turn Peddled the bike so fast I heard the rubble burn With the cops in hot pursuit I started feeling like a jerk I thought man all of this 'cause I was trying to get to work I could've got away I almost had 'em shook 'Til this girl walked by something said not to look But I thought what the heck a little peek can't hurt But she made me miss the sign that said men at work I screamed out loud as I crashed through the barricade I saw my whole life flash before my face I felt kind of dizzy all I saw was stars I put my hands over my eyes and settled on the handle bars That was stupid I got off track 'Cause about that point everything went black The next thing I remember is a head ache nagging I woke up face down in the back of a paddy wagon I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dead A big Flintstones lump on the side of my head They took my picture and my finger prints I said wait you can't arrest me I'm the Fresh Prince I demand that you release me you incompetent fool You can't arrest me I'm the Prince you know the rules You got five seconds 'fore I punch out your lights But then the cop pulled out his gun I said ha ha psyche I had a call so I called my boss I figured I might as well what else could be lost Boss I'm sorry that I couldn't make it today He said what are you talking about you're off today is Saturday Stuck in a cell scared as hell I'm a hungry kind of tired and I hate this awful smell Maybe one day I'll get smart and change my ways But for now it's just one of those days It's just one of those days

Is she mine I want to know (Well if you think long you think wrong. So don't think too long) -sing over chorus- Must decide how to go. Is she mine I want to know Must decide how to go. Is she mine I want to know Marriage or shacking, which way do we go One of us must let the other know By taking our time we will work our problems out 'Til death do we part or as friends we'll begin... Mind blowing (...again) decisions causes head on collisions Mind blowing decisions causes head on collisions (repeat chorus out)

Ni en tu sueño, bacatrán, tú le mete más que Calderón Te gusta la cherrie, ponte las Everready No vayas a flashiar como Strawberry ¿Cuál babilla? Si lo tuyo es irte en güira Pero si Dios te la dio, San Pedro te la bendiga Con tu gua-gua-gua te crees que intimida Cochinchillo, encabulla, vuelve y tiras Es el Tego Calde', el Abayarde En el 2002, mi socio, pa' luego es tarde Papo, camina Que el Abayarde la puso en China Pa' tu esquina maquina que me fui po' encima Tira la toalla que llegué con mi rinquincalla Mi propio estilo no te sale por más que lo ensayas Fuiste a la playa, te echaste collares y nada No te sale por más que lo ensayas Camina Que el Abayarde la puso en China Pa' tu esquina maquina que me fui po' encima"

I'm only I've got to go this place is poison now Now that you are gone and your ghost ignores me I beg and plead with eternity But this fantasy I see abhors me The visions come during day or night Angels, devils pray on my weak condition And out of reach there's a tiny light That could set things right if I could change position I'm only Falling through the cracks I'm only Losing my will to live I'm only Broken and beaten down I'm only... I'm only If only the sun could spare me this pain I would open up the doors and let him in And look into his eyes Just burn away your lies Tear you from my heart and from my soul I'm only Falling through the cracks I'm only Losing my will to live I'm only Broken and beaten down I'm only...

rap	"La vie est belle, le destin s´en écarte Personne ne joue avec les mêmes cartes Le berceau lève le voile, multiples sont les routes qu´il dévoile Tant pis, on n´est pas né sous la même étoile Pourquoi fortune et infortune, pourquoi suis-je né Les poches vides, pourquoi les siennes sont-elles pleines de thunes Pourquoi j´ai vu mon père en cyclo partir travailler Juste avant le sien en trois pièces gris BMW La monnaie est une belle femme qui n´épouse pas les pauvres Sinon pourquoi suis-je la tout seul marié sans dote Pourquoi pour lui c´est cash et vacances Pour moi c´est stade de foot sans cage, sans filet Sans même une ligne blanche Pourquoi pour lui c´est l´équitation Pour moi les bastons, Pour lui la coke, pour moi les flics en faction Je dois me débrouiller pour manger certains soirs Pourquoi lui se gave de saumon sur lit de caviar Certains naissent dans les choux, d´autres dans la merde Pourquoi ça pue autour de moi, quoi? Pourquoi tu me cherches? Pourquoi chez lui c´est des Noël ensoleillés Pourquoi chez moi le rêve est évincé par une réalité glacée Lui a droit à des études poussées Pourquoi j´ai pas assez d´argent pour acheter Leurs livres et leurs cahiers Pourquoi j´ai dû stopper les cours Pourquoi lui n´avait pas de frère à nourrir, Pourquoi j´ai dealé chaque jour Pourquoi quand moi je plonge, lui passe sa thèse Pourquoi les cages d´acier, les cages dorées agissent à leur aise Son astre brillait plus que le mien sous la grande toile Pourquoi ne suis-je pas né sous la même étoile La vie est belle, le destin s´en écarte Personne ne joue avec les mêmes cartes Le berceau lève le voile, multiples sont les routes qu´il dévoile Tant pis, on n´est pas né sous la même étoile La vie est belle, le destin s´en écarte Personne ne joue avec les mêmes cartes Le berceau lève le voile, multiples sont les routes qu´il dévoile Tant pis, on n´est pas né sous la même étoile Je peux rien faire Je peux rien faire, spectateur du désespoir Je peux rien faire Je peux rien faire, spectateur du désespoir Comme Issa, pourquoi ne suis-je pas né la bonne étoile Veillant sur moi, couloir plein de toiles, crachats Tchatche à deux francs, courbettes des tapettes devant Supporter de grandir sans 1 franc, c´est trop décevant Simplement en culotte courte Ne pas faire la pelle mécanique plate avec des pots de yaourt C´est pas grave, je n´en veux à personne, et si mon heure sonne Je m´en irai comme je suis venu Adolescent incandescent chiant à tour de bras sur le fruit défendu Innocents, témoins de types abattus dans la rue C´est une enfance? De la pourriture, ouais! Je ne draguais pas, mais virais des tartes aux petites avec les couettes Pâle de peur devant mon père, ma sœur portait le voile Je revois, à l´école les gosses qui la croisent, se poêlent C´est rien Léa, si on était moins scrupuleux Un peu de jeu du feu on serait comme eux Mais j´ai pleuré pour avoir un job, comme un crevard sans boire Les ""Je t´aime"" à mes parents, seul dans mon lit le soir Chacun son boulet, sans ambition la vie c´est trop long Écrire des poèmes, pisser violent dans un violon Tu te fixes sur le wagon, c´est la locomotive que tu manques C´est pas la couleur, c´est le compte en banque J´exprime mon avis, même si tout le monde s´en fiche Je ne serai pas comme ça si j´avais vu la vie riche La vie est belle, le destin s´en écarte Personne ne joue avec les mêmes cartes Le berceau lève le voile, multiples sont les routes qu´il dévoile Tant pis, on n´est pas né sous la même étoile La vie est belle, le destin s´en écarte Personne ne joue avec les mêmes cartes Le berceau lève le voile, multiples sont les routes qu´il dévoile Tant pis, on n´est pas né sous la même étoile Mon Dieu pourquoi ne puis-je vivre comme n'importe quel être humain? Pourquoi mon destin est-il de ne pouvoir cesser de me battre? Je peux rien faire Je peux rien faire Je peux rien faire Je peux rien faire, spectateur du désespoir"

rap	(Mary had a little lamb) That's a fib, she had two twins though And one crib Now she's only fourteen, what a start But this defect is ground common in these parts Now life in this world can be such a bitch And dreams are often torn and shattered and hard to stitch Negative's the attitude that runs the show When the stage is the g-h-e-t-t-o Which is the one to blame when bullets blow Either peter, jane, or john or joe But joe can't shoot a gun, he's always drunk And peter's pimping jane, and john's a punk Infested are the halls, also the brains Daddy's broken down from ghetto pains Mommy's flying high, the truth is shown The kids are all alone Cause it's just the ghetto thang It's just the ghetto thang (word) Who ranks the baddest brother, the ones who rule This title is sought by the coolest fool Define coolest fool? easy, the one who needs Attention in the largest span and loves to lead Always found at the jams, but never dance Just provoke violence due to one glance The future plays no matter, just the present flow When the greeting place is the g-h-e-t-t-o Lies are pointed strong into your skull Deep within your brain against the wall To hide or just erase the glowing note Of how to use the ghetto as a scapegoat Truth from trugoy's mouth is here to scar Those who blame the g for all bizarre So open up your vents and record well For this is where we stand, for the true tell Ghetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways Now there could be some ghetto gangs and ghetto play If ghetto thang can have its way in ghetto range Then there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change Though confident they keep it kept, we know for fact They lie like ghettos form, cause people lack To see that they must all get out the ghetto hold The truth they never told Cause it's just the ghetto thang It's just the ghetto thang (word) Do people really wish when they blow Out the cake candles, and if so Is it for the sunken truth which could arise From out the characters in which the ghetto hides Roses in the ring supply their shown relief Granted it's planted by their shown belief Kill and feed off your own brother man Has quickly been adopted as the master plan Posses of our people has yet to provoke Freedom or death to them, it's just a joke What causes this defect, I don't know Maybe it's the g-h-e-t-t-o It's just the ghetto thang (word) Standing in the rain is nothing felt When problems hold more value, but never dealt With buildings crumbling to the ground Impact noise is solid sound But who's the one to say this life is wrong When ghetto life is chosen strong We seem to be misled about our dreams But dreams ain't what it seems When it's just the ghetto thang It's just the ghetto thang (word)

rap	Endlich bist du wieder zurück Bilal Du bist trotz deines Erfolges, der selbe junge Mann geblieben Und genau das zeichnet dich aus Du bist ein ehrlicher, herzlicher und charakterstarker Mensch Geh deinen Weg weiter wie bisher Mit Herzblut Denn deine Reise hat gerade erst begonnen Nur der einzig Wahre weiß wohin die Reise mich bringt Wer meine Platte kritisiert, beleidigt mein Kind Denn dieses Album ist für mich so wie ein eigenes Kind Wenn das Kind spricht, dann hörst du Reime mit Sinn Manchmal weint es, die Hatershow, wie neidisch sie sind Kriegen einen Höhenflug obwohl das Schiff eigentlich sinkt Jede Wahrheit auf's Papier, schreibe ich hin Auch wenn du den' die Augen öffnest bleiben sie blind Seit mein Schwager verstarb hab ich das Lachen verlernt Es fühlt sich an als stach das Schicksal 'ne Axt in mein Herz Lieber Gott ich hab' aus falschen Sachen gelernt Heute weiß ich falsche Schlangen sind mein lachen nicht wert Ich danke euch für den Erfolg und den Kühlschrank der voll ist Glaub daran, wenn Gott dir 'ne Chance gibt Auch wenn der Porsche jetzt aus Chrom ist Sag was bringt dir das Ganze wenn du dafür deinen Stolz brichst? Und wäre ich heute so wie sie oder wie er Dann wäre ich sicher Millionär Ich war gerade zu meinen Mitmenschen und immer fair Denn ich glaube an Karma und weiß das alles wiederkehrt Man hat versucht mich indirekt in eine Ecke zu drängen Deswegen lasse ich von euren Rappern die Texte verbrennen Anscheinend sind eure herabwertende Sätze im Trend Jeder redet über Drogen, über Knäste und Gangs Sie verleugnen die Erziehung ihrer Eltern Und prahlen damit rum das sie mehr als alle Geld haben Mehr Geld als sie oder er, mehr als der Der für wenig Geld trotz harter Arbeit sein Kind ernährt Mehr als der, der vierzig Stunden ackern geht Nur damit am Ende des Tages auf dem Tisch etwas warmes steht Nur damit die Kinder was zu essen kriegen, rest in piece Ihr drecks MC's habt für mich nicht ein Cent verdient Die krassesten Gangster in der Szene mit dem krassesten Hype Wir haben alle schon verstanden das ihr die krassesten seid Wir haben alle schon verstanden ihr habt Waffen dabei Ich raffe es nicht, nein, wann kriegen das die Affen gepeilt Und mit der Zeit bete ich das eure Patte nicht reicht Ich bete das ihr alle fällt damit der Hass euch befreit Damit ihr endlich wach werdet und danach begreift Das ihr ohne Parra nichts seid, ihr arroganten Hab mich in Interviews für deutschen Rap gerade gemacht Nur damit keiner meiner Fans eure Namen nur hasst Doch anscheinend hat euch nicht meine Visage gepasst Obwohl ihr älter seid, sag was 'ne Blamage ist das? Selbst ein Hund der für Schutz bezahlt fängt an zu bellen Doch nur ein Streichholz könnte ganze Wälder verbennen Selbst ein Hund der für Schutz bezahlt fängt an zu bellen Doch nur ein Streichholz könnte ganze Wälder verbennen Sie beschimpfen Frauen Tag und Nacht Doch vergessen wer sie ganze neun Monate im Bauch getragen hat Wer hat euch gefüttert, als ihr kleine Kinder wart? War es keine Frau oder warum so behindert, huh? Alle Frauen sind angeblich richtig schlimm Doch was kann 'ne Frau dafür wenn du dich wie 'ne Bitch benimmst Was kann 'ne Frau dafür, bitte sag's mir Ich schäme mich dafür was ist mit deutschen Rap nur passiert? Sie beleidigen Frauen in ihren Gangster Parts Doch willst du das man so was über deine Schwester sagt? Willst du das deine Schwester solche Texte hört Wenn du keine Antwort hast dann bin ich echt empört Dann kommen Leute so wie du und sagen Bilal, das ist doch kein Rap, ich meine so ein Text Der wiegt doch viel zu nett, rap doch über Koks Was ist mit dir los? Wo sind all die Hoe's in deinen Videos? Werd' doch endlich böse damit alle sich fürchten Ich schwöre ich gehöre lyrisch zu den größten Und würde meine Würde niemals verkaufen nur damit Typen Die Tüten verticken mich mögen Ich lüge nicht wenn ich sage mich macht es müde Und psychisch geht es mir besser denn je Ich muss kotzen wenn ich all diese Rapper hier seh Ihr habt mehr Geld als alle, wir haben's alle kapiert Ihr habt die aller größten Eier, wir haben's alle kapiert Ihr habt den aller größten Rücken, wir haben's alle kapiert Was ist passiert ihr verbiegt euch wegen bisschen Papier Und dann macht ihr mir auf mächtig, glaube mir Karma Und merkt euch eine Sache Akhi, Yawmul Qiyama Ihr holt draußen Araber für einen Insta post Heutzutage wird man groß wenn man Kindern droht Was ist los kleine Free Fighter Doch Freunde die dein Geld verlangen sind keine Freunde sondern aller höchstens Dienstleister Jeden Tag gibt's Beef aber nix passiert Araber Clan Bruder aber wallah nix passiert Böse Blicke in den Videos aber nix passiert Harte Ansagen aus den Studios aber nix passiert Immer wieder das gleiche von Poponasen in Promophasen Denn sie reden von Villen obwohl sie nicht mal ne Wohnung haben Dann zeigen sie das sie Kohle tragen sozusagen Sind sie 'ne Hohle die ohne Drogen nix zu holen haben Ohne Gnade ich verschone gerade Idioten die sagen Dass sie Oberstars sind obwohl die so locker Arme vor der [?] schlafen Und ich habe meinen Eltern eines versprochen Bevor ich mich verbiege, wird mein Schweigen gebrochen Ich schreibe seit ein parr Wochen dieses Meisterwerk, ah Auf dieser Platte hörst du gleich mein Herz, ah Auf dieser Platte hörst du gleich mein Herz Deswegen bin ich von der Top Five nicht weit entfernt Ich danke meinen Fans die mich supporten und das Album kaufen An meine Fans die seit Tag Eins an mich glauben Wissen das ich nix halt' von Gewalt oder Angst Doch wenn's drauf ankommt, Bruder ja, dann steh' ich mein' Mann Ich steh' ich mein' Mann, die Lügner greifen gegen mich an Doch ich steh für die Wahrheit deutsch Rap ist elendig krank Steh' für die Wahrheit so wie Tupac Amaru Shakur Und für die Zeit mit Mama brauch' ich keine goldene Uhr Ich trag' keine Rolex, nein ich bin nicht dafür geboren Dafür hab' ich Zeit für meinen Neffen der sein Vater verlor Denn mein Schwager meinte Bilal du schwimmst gegen den Strom Kurze Zeit später hat der Engel ihm die Seele genommen Seit dem du weg bist hat man mir was von mei'm Leben genommen Ich schließ die Augen, denk an dich und sehe dich schon Und vielleicht gehe ich mit meinen Alben kein mal Gold Doch jede Platte die ich verkaufe ist auch dein Erfolg Die letzten Zeilen meines Intros widme ich nur dir Naser Du bist zwar tot, doch lebst noch in mir Naser Ich weine gerade, doch lebst noch in mir Naser Wir sehen uns irgendwann mal wenn ich stirb Naser Dein Sohn ist wie mein eigenes Kind Ich versprech dir das ich mit ihm schöne Zeiten verbring Dem Kleinen geht es sehr gut Dein Sohn, meine Schwester und du seid mein Herzblut

Schaue in den den Spiegel, ey, mein neuer Pulli steht dir gut Damit geh' ich raus, wie man das mit neuen Sachen tut Chille in der Nachbarschaft, ich treff' sie wieder Die Diva mit dem vielen Shiva, damals aus der geilen Nacht Nervös im Kopf, feucht die Hände, Haare heute blonde Schwarzes Top, Minirock Mann, sie war die Bombe! Ich merkte, sie gefällt mir sehr, dachte Mann, da geht noch mehr „Vielleicht ruf' ich dich an, sagte sie“ Das war schon lange her Mein Phone schwieg, blieb still, hängte ab, Lauryn Hill Und wenn es klingelte, dann war sie's wieder nicht Ey Mann, ich chill' Mach' mich locker, leb' mein Leben weiter Gott sei Dank! Ich kenn' so viele Typen, ey, die machte sowas krank Für sie brauchst du Energie, Mann, ich geb' ihr mehr als das Schreib' ihr tausend schöne Lieder, alle ohne Beat und Bass Ich lag daheim im Bett, es traf mich wie 'n Brett, dachte: Nett! Gesteh' ich meine Liebe oder lauf' ich weiter von ihr weg? Ich wollt', es wär' so einfach Doch ich weiß, dass ich dich nicht für mich allein hab' Siehst du Himmel, lügst du Blaues, ich kann dir nicht trauen Tausend Phrasen, tausend Frauen, was soll ich dir glauben? Ich wollt', es wär' so einfach Doch ich weiß, dass ich dich nicht für mich allein hab' Siehst du Himmel, lügst du Blaues, ich kann dir nicht trauen Tausend Phrasen, tausend Frauen, was soll ich dir glauben? Ich wollt', es wär' so einfach Doch ich weiß, dass ich dich nicht für mich allein hab' Siehst du Himmel, lügst du Blaues, ich kann dir nicht trauen Tausend Phrasen, tausend Frauen, was soll ich dir glauben?

rap	"O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè io devo mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto e non così. Sono in preda a una psicosi, rischio una nevrosi. Mami, non posso continuare questo andazzo da fuky gigolò, ogni giorno sul mio palco recitare lo stesso show di pupe a gogò, cristallo e Pinot, dolce vita, però spesso in stile Peppino e Totò. Le mie ex dicono che sono un bastardo bugiardo, ma io gioco d'azzardo la mia vita è un casinò. Ogni sera nel night di King Mauri, con i ragazzi della banda, cospirando manco si trattasse di una rapa in banca, per cacciar la tipa da portare in branda, seppur la compagnia di pupe non ci manca, trattasi di avventuriere straniere, amori che si rivelano chimere, le puoi vedere sparire alla luce del mattino come un sogno. Adesso basta, ora so di chi ho bisogno. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè io devo mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, prima o poi io devo metterla 'sta testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata. Magari una che mi contraddica qualsiasi cosa dica, che non mi faccia uscire con gli amici e poi mi porti al cinema io, lei e una sua amica. Che mi ripeta che sono disordinato, che mi chieda se ho bevuto, che quando sono affamato sia a dieta, che non mi creda se sono sincero e se mente lei pretende che me la beva. Che mi telefona mentre sto lavorando, e se le dico che al momento sono occupato: "" Ti richiamo"", quando la chiamo dice che non l'amo e fa l'offesa. Che abbia la pretesa che ogni giorno io le faccia una sorpresa. Si, mi ci vuole un pò di disciplina che mi obblighi a svegliarmi presto la mattina, che mi faccia stare un'ora a esaminare una vetrina, che quando danno un filmone in TV inviti gente a cena, che mi svegli per chiedermi se sto dormendo, che tenti di cambiarmi e poi mi accusi di stare cambiando. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè io devo mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè io devo mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto. Ma in fondo la mia vita non è poi malaccio, con i casini che faccio, i guai in cui mi caccio. So che non è serio cambiare ogni sera, ma preferisco un'overdose di libertà che una dose di galera. Cattivo coi nemici e con le bimbe un agnellino, ho più pupe io del gangster di Chicago; perfino al bar del Giambellino dicevan che ero un mago, mi chiamavan drago ma aspetta che ti spiego, forse la fidanzata non mi serve come prima ti dicevo. Continuerò a fare zig-zag fra soubrette e vedette e tete a tete con ballerine di tip-tap, ad essere infantile, ma con stile, fidanzare me è un'ingiustizia per la popolazione femminile, quindi una alla volta, avanti see'è posto, questo è il modo che mi da più gusto, quindi è quello giusto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, così le faccio mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè sto già vivendo in un modo giusto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, nessuno mi fa mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè per uno come me questo è il modo giusto. E shakera, sono Johnny Cannuccia, J.Ax, e Jack Shorty, Dj Jad, Articolo 31, dal 1940 al 1998 con lo Spaghetti Funk a palla, vai bella. Per i nostri bulli e per le nostre pupe, shakera"

rap	"Happy's not a faucet that'll flow when a handle is turned I wanna handle my shit, but it hasn't occurred I need the stamina, keep on like my grandmama When I'm not on camera I gotta be a man of my word And be a greater guy, not some thin-as-paper guy Like the times that Georgie Porgie kissed the girl And made her cry, saying, see ya later, bye Shit I say is pretty strange Coming back for Christmas and we bitch on how the city changed F*ck it, man, we're changing too, look at what we going through Mama used to buy me shirts she said that I would grow into But it's draping on me like an apron or a cape, A great tsunami wave of cotton that I'm caught in That she bought at Ross—I know the cost of it was probably awesome But my style is sorta sloppy I'll fit it when I blossom like a California Poppy The tears are freezing on my cheek in Boston out in Copley And I don't really know why, no I don't really know why All you can do, is All you can do, is All you can do, is All you can do, is So pour that liquor out. I never chickened out But if I got to make a second pick I'd take a different route But a grip of my decisions pretty Mickey Mouse I tried to join the 27 Club, they kicked me out It was like I'm limping into heaven while my dick is out And there's Amy Winehouse sitting on a cloud and drinking stout But she spits it out the moment I come gliding in She's all like, “come on Joplin, who the f*ck invited him?! Hide all of the Heinekens!"" No, they don't know my name My heart is lowkey broken so I'm taking Novocain And Jimmy Morrison the doors, and Brian Jones, you know, the Stones Are joking, toking on a roach playing a poker game I know that I'm a bastard. The walls are alabaster Jimi plays his Stratocaster jamming out with Kurt Cobain They're playing Purple Rain, or maybe Purple Haze And Kurt says, “How the f*ck they let this jerk in with his hurtful ways?” I try to jump and spread my wings like I'm a bird of prey But I hit the earth and break a mothafucka’s vertebrate (hey) I guess I'm fucking up the blueprint for success Woke up in the hospital with Jimi's bootprints on my chest This recklessness, no common senses I Kamikaze, there's consequences I don't condone it, but I did it, I'ma own it I've been living for the moment gotta go (go!) 'Cause All you can do, is All you can do, is All you can do, is All you can do, is All you can do, is All you can do, is All you can do, is All you can do, is"

Couldn't go to the hood for a week or two Always smoking some puto that I never knew Just kept on banging and didn't take it serious Hitting ten dollar sticks and acting delirious Not giving a f*ck about all the dirt we done We just sat back and laughed 'cause this shit was all fun Toker's out banging and I can't be faded I'm a true ass loco and straight gang related *scratches* ..gang related.. ..gang related.. ..gang related.. ..gang related.. ..gang related.. ..gang related.. ..gang related..

metal	An inquisitive mind Will always tune into the world beyond. Curiously you'll find yourself Observing it all with intrigue. So keep a close eye Such a detailed awareness Helps you to feel alive You're always watching, But it's only watching. This voice so confident And proud of chanting opinions Stuck in his verbal crusade Ranting an invented position You're only ever a witness To what you want to see You're glorifying this misperception. So fill your head With what you think you understand. My ears grow tired Of listening to this constant recital Lend yourself only when it suits For this worthy cause, for this worthy cause Feed the elevation that you so desperately, so desperately In all these words in which you preach I would have thought you'd act. But you're sitting too comfortably In a land so distant Watching for entertainment And in this voice of confidence Too proud to admit flawed opinions Bound to his verbal crusade Preaching his invented position. These tones will always Deceive the unfamiliar Still glorifying your misperception. So in love with the sound of you own voice And why? You would talk for eternity The watcher runs With the circles of his debate And in the end, what's been achieved?

metal	White man came across the sea He brought us pain and misery He killed our tribes, he killed our creed He took our game for his own need We fought him hard we fought him well Out on the plains we gave him hell But many came too much for cree Oh will we ever be set free? Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes Galloping hard on the plains Chasing the redskins back to their holes Fighting them at their own game Murder for freedom a stab in the back Women and children and cowards attack Run to the hills run for your lives Run to the hills run for your lives Soldier blue on the barren wastes Hunting and killing their game Raping the women and wasting the men The only good indians are tame Selling them whisky and taking their gold Enslaving the young and destroying the old Run to the hills run for your lives (repeat to end)
metal	I want to live in fire With all the taste I desire It's all good if you let me dive With sharks on the ground You lose your routine You lose your routine You lose your routine 'Cause I found my path What the hell are you trying?

Now I know there is something more That this is the truth It's all in you What do you came for? What did you expect to find? What do you came for? What did you expect to find? What do you came for? What did you expect to find? What do you came for? What did you expect to find? So boundless I feel And boundless all my fears Stop running back to old times You lose your routine 'Cause I found my path What the hell are you trying? Now I know there is something more What happened to you? Still staying on my path Are you still denying?

metal	Break down the walls of forever. Pull down hard on the lever. Let them know that you can turn the key. Though they try to hold us down. Turn it up, that chainsaw sound. I just love to see my parents flee. So you see that they're all going nowhere. Everybody's staring into space. Start the fire. Bring down the hammer. Start start the fire. Burning on forever. Now I see the storm clouds a coming. Can you feel the juice, it's a hummin'. Feed the power cables into me. Like a ship that's built for destruction. I'm a metal man of construction. And I'll fire my cannons, one by one. So you see that they're all going nowhere. Everybody's staring into space. Start the fire. Bring down the hammer. Start start the fire. Burning on forever.

metal	I awoke on impact Under surveillance from the camera eye Searching high and low The criminal mind found at the scene of the crime Handcuffed and blind, I didn't do it She said she loved me I guess I never knew But do we ever, ever really know? She said she'd meet me on the other side But I knew right then, I'd never find her I don't believe in love I never have, I never will I don't believe in love It's never worth the pain that you feel No more nightmares, I've seen them all From the day I was born They've haunted my every move Every open hand's there to push and shove No time for love it doesn't matter She made a difference I guess she had a way Of making every night seem bright as day Now I walk in shadows, never see the light She must have lied 'cause she never said goodbye I don't believe in love I never have, I never will I don't believe in love I'll just pretend she never was real I don't believe in love I need to forget her face, I see it still I don't believe in love It's never worth the pain that you feel No chance for contact There's no raison d'etre My only hope is one day I'll forget The pain of knowing what can never be With or without love it's all the same to me I don't believe in love I never have, I never will I don't believe in love I'll just pretend she never was real I don't believe in love I never have, I never will I don't believe in love It's never worth the pain that you feel, feel The pain that you feel, feel
metal	I'm just a human being A mistake made of feelings With a soul...wrapping in chains So fragile, full of pain No one knows why we are here Giving laughter and so many tears I will just do my best To keep my head above the rest No one really knows Which way the wind blows One day the tides will turn One day the fields will burn One day the seas will churn The fury of out maker's hand Man is a mistake cast out Shunned and cast down Giving life through breathe of gods W With itself always at odds The pious the preacher The liar, the creature F rom rock to fire The dust of man O my maker I need a savior One day the tides will turn O ne day the fields will burn One day the seas will churn T he fury of our makers hand The fury. The fury What will you do?
metal	Listen, I got the shivers and the chills Got an awful pile of bills to pay That's the prize for all the thrills Breakdown, I got the medals and the scars Had the brains to get this far Somehow I'll get by Cause somewhere over there Somewhere on the other side All this pain we bear Is all over It's over Thank you, for all the worst and all the best All the time it takes to figure out That is all some kind of test And all I know is that Somehow I'll get by Cause somewhere over there Somewhere on the other side All this pain we bear Is all over It's over Somewhere, somewhere over there Somewhere on the other side All this pain we bear Is all over It's over
metal	No rest from the demon within I'm always fighting to be free Battling the forces of evil Now fate has chose my destiny Walking through the fires of the land of the dead I'm between heaven and hell The righteous path is hidden from the wicked and the damned I'm between heaven and hell I stand at the gate of admission Where I've come I can not tell Visions of heaven before me, I cross the threshold And it's hell Between heaven and hell
metal	A fragile peace that exists inside A frame so shallow, so narrow-minded. An open wound - we run inside. A raging turmoil. Helplessness confides... [Chorus:] Cursed to crawl for pale and bleeding heart Cursed to crawl Pale and bleeding. Cursed to crawl for pale and bleeding heart Cursed to crawl PAle and bleeding. Enter this sphere, commonplace, borderline. Between my rage, Between my hate. Damn our mistakes. Fixation blinds. The pain of knowing the truth beyond... [Chorus x2] Unprepared. A gruesome display, perhaps a replay - self-inflicted. Reduced to nothing, my piece of mind seduced. Unworthiness. The scars never heal... [Chorus]

metal	Condemned to suffer, condemned to drown in this filth, condemned to dwell in misery, casualty of the world we've built. Cursed with awareness. Forever bearing this cross. Drowning in the disease of man. Watching innocent life be lost. And you don't see it. So blind it makes me sick. Feed on greed as others fall. Just another hypocrite. And ass you have lived as a parasite. So shall you be condemned to flames. I am your enemy. I'll destroy all you hold dear. Unleash the truth upon your earth. The one thing you most fear. A world of lies, but this truth won't set you free. Only expose the beasts for those who are and those who suffer to feed their greed. Witness to a living hell. A hell that has burned for years. Welcome to filth, the blood, the pain and the shedding of countless tears. Don't try to claim your innocence and don't for one second deny the truth. We all have been found guilty and the reckoning has begun. I will watch this world burn and I await the fall. The rapture is now upon us. Existence burns to dust. We all shall burn.

metal	(Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner) It was the year of madness and insanity. There was no other cure for my disease The overdose - I took it Rcause I had to flee, It was nearly a journey that had no return, The fever burned, I was gone - delirium. There I was striding to heaven and they were calling me From beyond and I heard : ³Dont look back !² But I did and my eyes, they can¹t forget that sight Rcause all water and land was dead. Destroyed, denied, all tears undried, The crawling chaos comes, The twilight died, eternal night, The crawling chaos comes. A giant maelstrom, absorbing what we¹d left back, The desert of cadaverous, mortal loam And jungles of decay and decadence, where once Had been the homelands of my people, Temples of my ancestors, they were gone, dead and gone Then the cracks in the ground, they were breaking up And all water was streaming in, Manifesting the sight of the dead Berlin And London and Paris were graves.
metal	No feeling when you told me goodbye No reason when you're living a lie Don't tell me what I already know I'm living memories of long ago I fool myself, I deny it all Wanna hide it away Lost moments never caring enough I was never good at playing it tough Still living in my own little world Still believing you're the only one It's always hard, never easier To face another day alone Every time it rains I fall apart I start to remember Every single time it rains I think of you.

metal	Be still, I want you to listen, it's all so silly Our ways have somewhere on the way surrendered Adjusted to the game and the dream is slightly shattered Guess the answer was never meant to be found And when the search is over Our questions still remain Enlighten me, I want to see, how this could be the age of reason Won't you tell me, can't you tell me Cause I need to know It's in my head it's in my soul The fire burns and my heart is sold To the melody and the music, yeah Please wake up, I want you to see, it could be so pretty Why do you turn a blind eye When you know you live a lie Enlighten me, I want to see, how this could be the age of reason Won't you help me, can't you help me I need to read between the lines It's in my head it's in my soul I'm on fire and my heart is old Like the melody and the music, yeah Enlighten me, I want to see, how this could be the age of reason Won't you tell me, can you tell me Why we don't read between the lines It's in my head it's in my soul A world on fire, the story's told In the melody and the music I want to see, how could it be the age of reason Won't you help me, I gotta know It's in my head it's in my soul A fire burns and my heart is sold In the melody of the music

metal	So I arrived, naked and cold A welcomed change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb No need for counsel I appreciate the time I’m not alone (Why don’t you get my lawyer on the phone) There were days these child eyes Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize I found my heart for the first time and I awakened in me I left myself to navigate, and oh I felt control (It seems these sheep have quite an appetite) Who is the crowd that peers through the cage, As we perform here upon the stage? As the boy became a man In came a calm sophistication I can hardly understand So lost in ego, didn’t notice when the time had slipped away (Yeah, everybody’s got a sob story) Jesus Christ, was born to die Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize We’re simply sociopaths with no communication baby I see your angle but we differ from our points of view (So tell me, what’s your cross to bear?) Who is the crowd that peers through the cage, As we perform here upon the stage? Tell me a lie in a beautiful way I believe in answers just not today Hope my wheels don’t abandon me now, Seeing that I’m out here alone I’m running out of fight And the wind speaks a comforting voice, Guiding me to her arms Mother, I’m alright It took the birth of sin to snake-rattle the mind Before a blow to the head by the gavel of time To wake up Won’t you wake up? When did the walking apes decide that nuclear war Was now the only solution for them keeping the score? Just wake up Can’t you wake up? (You do know this is just a simulation, don’t you?) Who is the crowd that peers through the cage, As we perform here upon the stage? Tell me a lie in a beautiful way I believe in answers just not today
metal	Gunfire up in heaven no religion here raping your salvation, the last sound that you'll hear the snap of the noose the crack of the whip the hangman's face is torn in shameless crucifixion a savage nation's born Behold the new messiah, arising from the wound in rags of execution freedom is consumned You are a rose you are a blade I'm down on my knees in the dark in the fiery reign life among the ruins I've lived among the ruins walked among the dead loved among the wreckage beneath a flag of red communion of blood so bitter the cup a union born of fear creation and perdition a world within a tear Behold the new messiah, arising from his bed holier in silence, paler than the dead [Chorus] [Chorus/with - I challenge you to love my bride of pain] With the dying sun of autumn bathing us in gold we walk the desolation hand in hand against the cold while rampant runs the reaper all through the barren plains with sycthe in hand he reaches to harvest the last remains in agony you stumble with a curse upon your lips you die I can't feel you anymore vengeance is mine!

His 'strife stirred France' repaid by those Who'll raise their hearts To spite the people of Canterbury. Ethereal Cathedral, Your voice, the voice of Canterbury, Resist your temptations And look to the wind, for conspiracies, ooh Infamy! They say 'strike him down!' 'strike him down!' Let stone and oak decay the crown. Who'll raise their hearts To spite the people of Canterbury. When her dead breath has numbered the land, And Barons will rule as they planned. Oh Cathedral you've died! Oh Cathedral you lied! The sins of our Fathers, You are here with me, Can we forgive you? For the fall of Canterbury.

You say, ""Son, let's forget the past, I want another chance, gonna make it last."" You're begging me for a brand new start, Trying to mend a bridge that's been blown apart, But you know you never built it dad. So I sit here through the night, And I write myself to sleep, And time keeps ticking Time has made you finally realize Your loneliness and your guilt inside. You're reaching for something you never had, Turning around now you're looking back, And you know I'm not there. You say, ""Son, let's forget the past. I want another chance, gonna make it last."" You're begging me for a brand new start, Trying to mend a bridge that's been blown apart, But you know you never built it dad."

metal	It begins with a dark glowing ember, Something black burning it's way out of me. Searing the flesh, Pain is the only thing I feel, Scars all I see. Oh no the fire's burning my insides again, What can I do to silence my desire tonight? Face consumer reason leaving all the ashes there, You won't catch me for granting my decision, I can't keep telling myself what I want to hear, I can't just close my eyes. I know that it's killing me, And it's poisoning the best of me, But I say, I don't want to believe. So let me tell you boy, tell you boy, About the lies I lead. That is how it kills, I got some flames and gasoline Broken teeth replace the blackout memories in my head Wreckage from the blast, it often shakes me to the floor (to the floor) I know it's over but I can't go home tonight. And after this I feel as empty as the night before, Feel the pain and yet I'm still begging for more. Masochistic, nihilistic, gurging wrecked up thoughts My life's a mess and I can't find a way to fix it. I can't keep telling myself what I want to hear, I can't just close my eyes (my eyes, my eyes, my fucking eyes) I know that it's killing me, And it's poisoning the best of me, But I say, I don't want to believe. So let me tell you boy, tell you boy, About the lies I lead. Calling, calling out. The darkness reaches up my soul, I'm riddled with self-doubt. Crawling, crawling out, My will to fight will more than suffice, While others will lay down. It's only as dark as you make it. I know that it's killing me, And it's poisoning the best of me, But I say, I don't want to believe. So let me tell you boy, tell you boy, About the lies I lead.

metal	Here where the dream of eden waits The rivers running easy In their valleys they are slumbering There the mysteries reveal By the clearness I can feel And an island in the stream appears before my eyes I am hunting lonesome traces in the sand And someone speaks my name from far away The ruins of yesterday will disappear I will reach for the sources of light As we are all finding our new hemisphere I am turning just yearning to feel Feel your dreams, don't toss them away [Chorus] Ancient myth arcana, Elysian seas of time The stones of wisdom shine again, the moonlight hides the rhyme In long gone days of yore, one thousand years before The odyssey was in our dreams, arcana we explore Here I can feel the inner flame Could forget what we became And the false mirages can't deceive, deceive me no more I am facing countless shadows in despair But I won't follow them into the gloomy calm aside of light [Chorus] Thorns of roses that I feel, secrecy under the seal Hear the tolling of the bell, bring me under your spell See the mysteries in twilight they're turning away From darkness to light (into infinity) Here where the dreams of Eden's near Leaving to a distant sphere To Elysian seas of time we ride I am longing for infinity Arcana, arcana Tonight this journey seals my fate Far beyond the open gate To the secret places never seen before For this final odyssey into Arcana, arcana

Ride on, see you, I could never go with you No matter how I wanted to. When you ride into the night Without a trace behind, Run your claw along my gut, one last time. I turn to face an empty space Where you used to lie, And look for a spark that lights the night Through a teardrop in my eye. Ride on, see you, I could never go with you No matter how I wanted to.

metal	You never listen in to what they know They only play the songs you've always known Can replace the roll of fifty nine As you are and always were in love that time You're unsure of the marriage vow Lived it once, and in it hide you now, The morning ash the fire of sixty nine Will remain with you and hope for better times Out of phase Will you always be Out of phase Getting back to me Out of phase, out of phase Finding love, you go to memories Hold on tight, romantic hearts are near Going somewhere, is there anywhere That smiles aloud, a place where all are proud. Out of phase Will you always be Out of phase Getting back to me Out of phase, out of phase Looking around me You're not the only one Looking for something old Looking for something done Out of phase, out of phase Out of phase, out of phase Wo oh oh wo oh oh Out of phase Will you always be Out of phase Getting back to me Out of phase, out of phase Never seeing, never saying who you are Don't conform to them You're better as you are, Out of phase, out of phase...
metal	響く足音が離れてゆく 雨は心さえ濡らして 抱えきれない孤独の薔薇を 飾るこの街の片隅に 静けさの中に溺れた 吐息は硝子細工のメロディ 触れたなら崩れ落ちて あなたには二度と戻れない 愛する人 もしもあなたに出会う事がなければ この痛みさえも 知らず誰かを この手で傷つけていた 流れ始めた時間と涙は 硝子細工のメロディ ひび割れた鏡の中にはもう この姿さえも映らない 傷だらけの心を隠す 意味などない 見つめて 愛で抱きしめて 壊れ始めた 心が 枯れてゆくまで 一人にしないでくれ 隣で笑ってくれ 夜が明けるまで 過ぎ去った日々を見つめて その傷に誓いと別れを 共に歩いてゆこう どんな苦しみも抱きしめて 愛する人 もしもあなたに出会う事がなければ この温もりさえ 知らなかった この手で掴みたい...強く 輝く日々 それは 過去ではなく未来にあるはずだから Oh my destiny 愛する人よ 側にいて 枯れてゆくまで

metal	Think Of the days when I had too much Of the things we found Resistance died down Fell on frozen soil Bleed a little for a different day Going deeper to come away On the concrete sky I saw the buildings rise But keep our lights in shadow still In the wind's eye Where our reflection dies Glass shrines of muted will Dead Is the time that I see from here on out This burial ground One more down And buildings recoil
metal	Now from a solar system To another I fly I come with life in my veins Through darkened space I ran I left a struggle behind And faced the fear that?s alive I lost a world and traveled Straight across from the sky To find the gates of the heart I come to Sirius see To learn from you friends of old And wish to come into being And behold I?m with you I am ready now to go The distance and even beyond Recover all my forces All the strength of the world And feel the light into me From the strength of god We go to the power of goddess This place is a throne For brightness The age of war is over For god?s sake The have never heard of you ?You?ll never reach This master race?

metal	I don't believe in fame, I believe in music. I don't believe in money, I believe in the power of love. I know I got a brain and I know how to use it. I don't want no one to stick his finger in my pie. You think you put your best foot forward But it is moved by someone else. In blind belief you follow every path that says: I lead you to a universe of fortune, fame and luck. Do you really want to be - rich and famous, rich and famous. Do you really want to be - rich and famous now. I don't believe in Rock 'n' Roll illusions. I don't believe that what they say must always be the truth. I don't believe in good guys against bad guys. I just might as well say I believe in Santa Claus. Mr. Big shot wat is your game Mr. Big shot what is your final aim. Now you wonder who is to blame. Mr. Big shot what is your final aim in life. Rich and famous, house with two hours, big jacuzzi, car with TV. Private airplane, furs and diamonds, seafood cocktails- CRAP AND BULLSHIT!

metal	He threw down a glove you made the mistake Of picking it up now you're gone The choosing of guns or fighting with swords The choice of weapons is done He'll tear you apart as soon as you start You know you don't have a chance. [Chorus] Oh, oh, fight for the honor Fight for the splendor Fight for the pleasure Oh, oh, fight for the honor Fight for the splendor Fight for your life! Ready to start the duel begins the best man wins in the end. A lunge and a feint, a parry too late A cut to the chest and you're down Seeing the stain then feeling the pain Feeling the sweat on your brow. [Chorus] The fighting resumes, a silence looms the swordsmen move 'gainst each other A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow, a stab to the heart and you're down The Angel of Death hears your last breath Meanwhile the Reaper looks on. Oh, oh, fought the honor Fought for the splendor Fought for the pleasure Oh, oh fought for the honor Fought for the splendor Fought to the death

metal	For too long now, there were secrets in my mind For too long now, there were things I should have said In the darkness...I was stumbling for the door To find a reason - to find the time, the place, the hour Waiting for the winter sun, and the cold light of day The misty ghosts of childhood fears The pressure is building, and I can't stay away I throw myself into the sea Release the wave, let it wash over me To face the fear I once believed The tears of the dragon, for you and for me Where I was, I had wings that couldn't fly Where I was, I had tears I couldn't cry My emotions frozen in an icy lake I couldn't feel them until the ice began to break I have no power over this, you know I'm afraid The walls I built are crumbling The water is moving, I'm slipping away... I throw myself into the sea Release the wave, let it wash over me To face the fear I once believed The tears of the dragon, for you and for me Slowly I awake, slowly I rise The walls I built are crumbling The water is moving, I'm slipping away...

metal	"I'm twenty six years old - please tell me what have I got A monopoly on misery - I guess that's my lot Ten years of eating bullshit leaves it's taste in your mouth And I think the time has come for me to spit it all out... 'Cause at the end of the tunnel I see A dole-queue that's beckoning me. Yes living hand-to-mouth it can be fun for a while Simple things please simple minds - do you see me smile? I've broke my bread and fishes - turned my water to wine But I'm sick of walking tightrope on the poverty line I left my home and family - I've pawned all my dreams Took a second mortgage on my soul to further my schemes Now my body's in the pages of ""exchange and mart"" Ten pounds or nearest offer for one slightly broken heart. And at the end of the rainbow I found A crock of shit there on the ground. Have you had a bellyful of emptiness Do you feel like me we're all just wasting our time If it's true inside each cloud's a silver lining Why does it shine on other lives but not on mine? I've had a bellyful of emptiness I've got a pocketful of nothing at all In real-life fairy tales the frog stays a frog And the serving girl can't be the belle of the ball. You're not the belle of the ball Get back in your cinders and crawl How many other fools like me Have lost their lives contractually Believing there must be far more Than nine to five - the factory floor? Have countless thousands watched their dreams Corrupted into things obscene By money minded bastards who Don't give a damn for me or you? Now my wallet's getting thinner like the hair on my head By the time I hit the ""big Time"" I'll be buried and dead Tell me how can you resent me for the money I've spent On the only habit I indulge (that's paying the rent)? No-one said this life was easy Christ I've known that all along But it needn't be this difficult that's why I wrote this song The sex and drugs and rock 'n 'roll were never meant to last And the bailiffs knocking on your door don't need a backstage pass! Be sure that you read between their lines There are claws in the contracts we sign. Have you had a bellyful of emptiness Do you feel like me we're all just wasting our time If it's true inside each cloud's a silver lining Why does it shine on other lives but not on mine? I've had a bellyful of emptiness I've got a pocketful of nothing at all In real-life fairy tales the frog stays a frog And the serving girl can't be the belle of the ball."

metal	The sun is sleeping quietly Once upon a century Wistful oceans calm and red Ardent caresses laid to rest For my dreams I hold my life For wishes I behold my night The truth at the end of time Losing faith makes a crime I wish for this night-time To last for a lifetime The darkness around me Shores of a solar sea Oh how I wish to go down with the sun Sleeping Weeping With you Sorrow has a human heart From my god it will depart I'd sail before a thousand moons Never finding where to go Two hundred twenty-two days of light Will be desired by a night A moment for the poet's play Until there's nothing left to say I wish for this night-time To last for a lifetime The darkness around me Shores of a solar sea Oh how I wish to go down with the sun Sleeping Weeping With you I wish for this night-time To last for a lifetime The darkness around me Shores of a solar sea Oh how I wish to go down with the sun Sleeping Weeping With you
metal	A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told So get a good hold, yeah Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know So let it all go! Turn up the night! Turn up the night! Turn up the night, it feels so right! Night time sorrow, taken like a pain Black will not become a white, it's all the same Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn! A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul So get a good hold, yeah Turn up the night! Turn up the night! Turn up the night, it feels so right! Turn up the night! Turn up the night! If it feels right Turn off the light! Turn up the night!

metal	You were raised up from the steam in the city Where your daddy dragged you 'round From place to place Now you're a grown-up A cool guy looking pretty But the childhood had its mark upon your face Now you're the hungry one, you want it all And enough is not enough You're always coming back for more When the race is on you roll the ball You found your heaven behind the backstage door You're all fed up With their parental domination Don't let them wear away your pride Cut the wire Jump the gun There is nothing that's holding you back Cross the fire Hit 'n' run You're forever unchained Jump the gun In another town, on another stage You've been cruising around, for at least a human age That rock'n'roll was your key to succeed Your restless soul Has taken off from the street So if you like it now You'll learn to love it later Stick to your dreams, and go ahead And now you're up to front A youth of desperation Go out and penetrate their minds You preach the words They put them out in circulation Get out, seek and find
metal	One thing That I got for you Is the one thing That you never do One thing makes you feel brand new Is the one thing that your coming to Just the one thing Gets you in the mood You call my number in the middle of the night To tell me nothing else can make you feel alright But it rings and rings you hang it up And call me back again One thing That I got for you Is the one thing That you never do One thing That you got to choose Is the one thing you can never lose Just the one thing is your attitude You call my name in the middle of the night When your makin' love and it feels alright But it's him not me Can't you see a shot of reality? I know what you do I know what you want to do I know when the lights go out I know what you are gonna to do One thing That I got for you Is the one thing That you never do Just the one thing gets you in the mood Just the one thing its your attitude One thing is one thing Just the one thing Oh!
metal	Into the abyss I'll fall-the eye of Horus Into the eyes of the night-watching me go Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this temple Enter the risen Osiris-risen again. [Chorus] Tell me why I had to be a power slave I don't want to die, I'm a god, why can't I live on? When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid to waste. And in my last hour, I'm a slave to the power of death. When I was living this lie-fear was my game People would worship and fall-drop to their knees So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me For he is a man and a god-and he will die too. [Chorus] Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins, Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone Shell of a man God preserved-a thousand ages But open the gates of my hell-I will strike from the grave. [Chorus]

Now as my time's passing by What am I waiting for? Who'll grant me wings to fly? And will I have another try? 'Cause I would not miss my moment again Yes, I would not miss this moment my friend No one knows the answer What could have been The edge I still fear The roads they're leading nowhere There is no end Oh gods be with me Carry me along In blindness I tried to march on Mystified me Yes, it fooled me No surrender Don't surrender I hear them calling I hear them calling Can hear them scream Don't be late when aeons pass Your memories will fade Even the purest one might fail Here and deceive The righteous soul And then their world will come undone They burn, they bleed Till the savior will break through In between the realms they're gathered And from the edge of time Once more they return, they will save us all Now break through Recall the eclipse There is none who survive Defeat, defeat, defeat There's no more You've searched for the answer The answer is creed They're real no more You cannot get over My light shall shine forever The Nine beyond the wall They're turning They're burning They now understand I soon will seal all doors Their stars won't shine here anymore Their savior won't even try He can't remember the truth My words become real And there's nothing they can do They may follow a plan they once had Deeply sad They have chosen the wrong side and tried to resist All their visions and music no longer exist When the morrow will come it shall all be In between the realms, in between the realms they might move on That's when all pureness dies in vain There's no release The infernal lord has won And forevermore Yes, forevermore They burn, they bleed Till the savior will break through In between the realms they're gathered And from the edge of time Once they return they will save us all Now break through Will I Yes, will I fail to believe, my friend? What if it's all done in vain? Don't be afraid Will it be me they blame? See, it's a whole world that I've once condemned And I shattered it all with a thought as it seems But it all has been me as the mirror has revealed Now reveal Now redeem I will carry the storm (the savior's coming home) Yes, I'll carry the grail and I'll wash away the pain There's no release The infernal lord has won And forevermore Yes, forevermore They burn, they bleed Till the savior will break through In between the realms they're gathered And from the edge of time Once they return they will save us all Now break through I don't look back There's more in me My hour shall come The old gods are calling Then straight ahead A door appears The tyrant must go down That's when the ancient gods return (they will return)

metal	Another memory and I'm asking myself Why can't I let the past be the past Once and for all take a hold of the future And not let it control what I aspire to have I see where my decisions have brought me What's done is done and its time to start again Can't let it tear me in two waste me away I gotta believe Cause this is now How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today This is now If I control myself I control my destiny What I've seen and what I've been through has made me who I am There was a time in my life where I had no desire to carry on I couldn't see a place for me or a will to survive I never thought to rely on myself or the beliefs that I have denied But this is now How can I can change tomorrow if I can't change today This is now If I control myself I control my destiny If I control myself I control my tomorrow I got to change today Cause this is now How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today I must control myself if I'm to control my destiny Cause this is now Cause this is now How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today This is now If I control myself I control my destiny

I still don't know what happened there, my mind is blocked, I was too scared. But they told me you had died, now the future's out of sight. If I could have seen it coming I'd had turned the other way, but then we were smashed, our lifes were torn apart. They can tell me a hundred times I'm not to blame. I didn't turn the steering wheel around... Once I feel in love with you, now I can't stop feeling blue. Will I ever be the same? Free me from this crying shame, Hey, you won't find me.

metal	Watch you like an outer satellite Watch every move you make You got me running, electrified I've got a feeling, a feeling so strong Can't miss with this emotion Can't fail to satisfy I'll sail the stormy oceans To let our hearts collide Too much, too fast I'm in and out of trouble Days have gone, nights have past But your heart is mine at last Want your love, need your love Honey, I don't settle for less 'Cause your love is enough to satisfy me Hey you! Always focussed on your precious heart Felt every aim was true You were the target right from the start Since you came walking out of the blue Too much, too fast I'm in and out of trouble Days have gone, nights have past But your heart is mine at last [Chorus] Need you a little closer Got to have you near me Need your love so bad [Chorus]
metal	I can see When you stay low Nothing happens Does it feel right? Late at night Things I thought I'd put behind me Haunt my mind I just know there's no escape now Once it sets it's eyes on you But I won't run Have to stare it in the eyes Stand my ground I won't give in No more denying I've gotta face it Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside If I don't make it, someone else will Stand my ground It's all around Getting stronger, coming closer into my world I can feel that it's time for me to face it Can I take it? Though this might just be the ending Of the life I held so dear But I won't run There's no turning back from here Stand my ground I won't give in No more denying I've gotta face it Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside If I don't make it, someone else will Stand my ground All I know for sure is that I'm trying I will always stand my ground Stand my ground I won't give in, (I won't give in) I won't give up, (I won't give up) No more denying (ah) I've gotta face it Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside If I don't make it, someone else will Stand my ground I won't give in No more denying I've gotta face it Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside If I don't make it, someone else will Stand my ground
metal	Watching the time go and feeling belief grow Rise above the obstacles People beseech me but they'll never teach me Things that I already know (I know) Dreams that have shattered may not have mattered Take another point of view Doubts will arise though like chasing a rainbow I can tell a thing or two (that's true) You've got to believe in yourself or no one Will believe in you Imagination like a bird on the wing Flying, free for you to use (okay baby) I can't believe they stop and stare And point their fingers doubting me Their disbelief suppresses them But they're not blind it's just that they won't see I'm a believer, I ain't no deceiver Mountains move before my eyes Destiny planned out I don't need no handout Speculation of the wise
metal	An Iron fist quietly sits inside the Velvet Glove Take control, untouchable just like God above I can't escape, wrapped in red tape, what will become of me?

metal	I don't care for this world anymore I just want to live my own fantasy Fate has brought us to these shores What was meant to be is now happening I've found that I like this living in danger Living on edge it makes feel as one Who cares now what's right or wrong, it's reality Killing so we survive Wherever we may roam Wherever we may hide We've got to get away I don't want existence to end We must prepare ourselves for the elements I just want to feel like we're strong We don't need a code of morality I like all the mixed emotion and anger It brings out the animal the power you can feel And feeling so high on this much adrenalin Excited but scary to believe what we've become Saints and sinners Something within us We are lord of flies Saints and sinners Something willing us To be lord of the flies
