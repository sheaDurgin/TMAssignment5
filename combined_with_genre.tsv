blues	"When they begin the beguine It brings back the sound of music so tender It brings back a night of tropical splendor It brings back a memory ever green I'm with you once more under the stars And down by the shore an orchestra's playing And even the palms seem to be swaying When they begin the beguine To live it again is past all endeavor Except when that tune clutches my heart And there we are, swearing to love forever And promising never, never to part What moments divine, what rapture serene Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted I know but too well what they mean So don't let them begin the beguine Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember When they begin the beguine Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play Till the stars that were there before return above you Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you"" Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine When they begin the beguine"

country	When I was walking down the street, a billboard caught my eye. The advertisement written there would make you laugh and cry. The sign was torn and tattered from the storm the night before, And as I gazed upon it, well, this is what I sawr: Smoke Coca-Cola cigarettes. Drink Wrigley's Spearmint beer. Ken-L-Ration dog food makes your wife's complexion clear. Chew chocolate-covered mothballs -- they're sure to satisfy. Brush your teeth with Lifebuoy soap and watch the suds go by. When I recovered from the sock, I went along my way. I'd gone no further than a block, when there to my dismay, Another billboard caught my eye, just like the one before, As I gazed upon it, well, this is what I sawr: Take your next vacation in a brand-new Frigidaire. Learn to play piano in your winter underwear. Simonize your baby with a Hershey's candy bar, And see the difference that Drano makes in all the movie stars! Doctors say that babies shouldn't smoke 'til they are three. People over 35, take baths in Lipton Tea. Oh, you can make America a better place today -- Just buy a copy of this song and throw it far away!

country	Deep in December, the year has grown old The days have grown dark and the nights have turned cold And the hurts that we harbor, the debts that we owe Are sleeping down under a blanket of snow It covers the grasses, the bench in the park The scars in the earth where man's made his mark And high in the sky there's an unearthly glow Like a miracle sent to delight us below And all our cares seem immaterial Beneath a light so ethereal As if all our wrongs could be made right Oh darling, under the northern lights We wound and we're wounded by the tiniest acts We run from our ghosts and we cover our tracks And we try to make up for mistakes that we've made With presents and parties and Christmas parades But I'm tired of the running, I'm taking my leave And the fire's burning low on this cold Christmas Eve All that I have is this evening to spend All that I want is to hold you again To linger awhile in the mystery To know the gift that's been given me Just to lie beside you this Christmas night Oh darling, under the northern lights
country	We step out on the dance floor, the band starts to play Holding you close I get carried away Finding that falling is easy to do Lost in the feeling with you Time standing still as I whirl you around We're dancing without even touching the ground Finding that falling is easy to do Lost in the feeling with you No words are spoken That don't need to be said You and the music Have gone to my head But I'll just go on when the music is through Lost in the feeling with you Lost in the feeling with you

With cool and silvery eyes and a? heart that was fit for desire, Drowned in a river of tears oh a river she cried left her with a heart, made of ashes and fire. Ashes and fire, Ashes and fire, Ashes and fire.

metal	"He himself said, that hell Was originally prepared for the devil and his angels. In hell, you will be ruled over And will be inferior by darkness and the forces of evil. Your new home will be made up of demons, Fallen angels, wickedness and even the lord of Darkness himself You will be at the bottom of the guest list. The sphere of hell is a hollowed-out place in the earth's core. Scientists proved that the earth's Outer crust is less than twenty miles thick And that beyond that point, there are rivers and Lakes of flaming blood of the earth, called the ""lake of fire"". Long Before the final judgment, of the thousand suns You will find the gates to hell in burning ruins of The new city. When the sinner closes his eyes for the second death And darkness takes his soul, you will see And feel movements in the air. The saviors are open you And there will be no triumph without loss, no freedom For your soul without sacrifice. There's only specific kind of creature, who ever Came back from the eternal. This very moment, your eternal soul may be less Than twenty miles from the burning fires of hell! If you go to hell, be sure, You'll be there forever"
metal	Incarnated marvels simplified Effects from such a disconsolate kind Impotence of the once so perfect living Erase and rewind Stand rigid for the next battle Peace means reloading your guns The love for life is all hatred in disguise A carnival creation with masks undone In search for the guidelines to the gateways of sin Through mires of misanthropy with wrath in mind Sophistication as cruelty and perfection as virulent truth Confidently dawned, to pick the best of enemies An abyss womb stretched wide open, exposed to retaliate With the stigma feasting upon your flesh I wish you well Thorns from the fountains of fate licking lepered skin Worshiped by anyone's mass on our planet Hell What on earth possessed you? Consuming illusions made from hysteria and swallowed tongues Devoured by doubt, conducting arts of misconception Testimonial sufficiency declaring numbness of all perceptions Glance into the blackness hidden beneath your surface And enjoy the suffering, sanity drained in disrespect With such bedeviled faith in good, subsequently trusting evil Next step for mankind will be the last seasons in sin With the stigma feasting upon your flesh as I wish you well Thorns from the fountains of fate licking lepered skin Worshiped by anyone's mass on our planet Hell What on earth possessed you? Consuming illusions made from hysteria and swallowed tongues Left are the kings of the carnival creation Carrying out the echoes of the fallen Sense the withering eternity as it fades away The ultimate graceless voyage of all times Only death will be guarding your angels, silently Cripples joining arms in clamor Institutionalized for the rebirth, the herd will be hunted

metal	"Life as dreams Streets of gold You used to go there Now you're draining down the bottle Systems failing Sirens wailing It's no secret that you're headed for the farm child It's time you're leaving Take a break down to the shore You used to love it where the Holy waters flow Maybe you'll find your long lost message in a bottle Sent long ago To your self long ago What are you looking for? The line is long You're too far out No hidden meanings here But I have to spell it out Sleep in late Or never wake Missing such a good time Thinking that you're never gonna throw it all away They found your message on the other side of life But they don't want you over They don't wanna cry Seems that you've gone too far caught up in your self Better find your way out It's not all about ""You"" Into the light of the sun Now you're gone Send me a word out of faith You'll be home Far away You make believe before you go to sleep That life is going your way The things you need are superficial indeed And leading you astray, far away Its time you're leaving take a breakdown to the shore You used to love it when the Holy Waters flowed Maybe you'll find your long lost message in a bottle Sent long ago Is it just all about you?"

I do what I do, it's all I can do I do, I do, do you?

Unveil the pentagram, And feel the demons lust, Come watch the holy men, Who look on in disgust, Come taste blood, And feel the heat of Satan's breath, Look in the sky's and see, The warriors of death, All hell breaks loose, Hell's breaking loose, Witching hour. Our work is now complete, The blood runs fast and free, And Satan takes his bride, And cry's of blasphemy, All hell rejoices at the child, That she will bear, And Satans only son, Shall be the worlds despair, All hell breaks loose, Hell's breaking loose, Witching hour.

metal	The night of timeless fire is drawing near I flee, throughout the years of throe Watching through a mirror, as I fall apart I see a wreck, I'm burning I see angels burning, falling down in ruins Looking down I see me, I'm my own enemy Watching myself decaying, falling from high spirits I flee, throughout the ruins of me Longing for finding my way out Leaving myself, there's nothing left for me The ruins are about to crumble down. The flame is dying by shivery winds of jet black skies It reflects hatred in my eyes I see angels burning, falling down in ruins Looking down I see my ashes scattered around my grave Angels whispering fire, no longer I'm alive Settled down I'm done with the trip to my kingdom come

Moi je sais!""

[Chorus] [Verse 2:] Now there's me and you, and everyone else, I remember when I used to only think about myself, But you changed that fast, love is changing me, I used to be a playa then we came to be, True chemistry, I believe you're my destiny, Cause I'm free when you're next to me, You're a lady in the living room, a freak in the bedroom, Oh so for real when I'm bumpin' to neck tunes, You can nibble on my neck, don't stop too soon, Let me know before you cum so I can cum with you, This is sexual healin', and I'm a sex fiend, So let's stay together like my name was Al Green, Yea, I got you, like I told you so, I'ma hold you in my arms and never let go, And at first I smiled, and then you blushed, You got everything I want and I can never get enough. [Chorus] [Verse 3:] The way you move, just turns me on, You steal my breath, you turn me on, You keep me up all night long, You just keep on turning me on, The way you move, just turns me on, You steal my breath, you turn me on, You keep me up all night long, You just keep on turning me on.

pop	Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl. Nighttime would fine me in Rosa's Cantina, Music would play and Felina would whirl. Black as the night were the eyes of Felina, Wicked and evil while casting a spell. My love was strong for this Mexican maiden, I was in love, but in vain I could tell. One night a wild young cowboy came in, wild as the west Texas wind... Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing, With wicked Felina, the girl that I love. So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden; Down went his hand for the gun that he wore. My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor. Just for a moment I stood there in silence, Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done. Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there; I had but one chance and that was to run. Out through the back door of rose's I ran, out where the horses were tied I picked a good one; he looked like he could run, Up on his back and away I did ride. Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso, Out through the badlands of New Mexico. Back in El Paso my life would be worthless; Everything's gone in life nothing is left. But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden, My love is stronger that my fear of death. I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark... Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me, Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart. And as last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso, I can see Rosa's Cantina below. My love is strong and it pushes me onward, down off the hill to Felina I go. Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys, Off to my left ride a dozen or more. Shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me, I've got to make it to rose's back door. Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel A deep burning pain in my side. Though I am trying to stay in the saddle, I'm getting weary, unable to ride. But my love for Felina is strong and I writhe where I've fallen. Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle, I feel the bullet go deep in my chest. From out of nowhere, Felina has found me, Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side. Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for, One little kiss and Felina good-bye.

pop	She was a women of mystery. And what she wanted I could not see. A three year trip on the dragon, Until the clinic had to get me clean. We were a party and always drunk. Befre I knew it, the wreckage sunk. Shake, trip, shimmy and we'd do the bump, Everybody's swingin' to the Brown Derby Jump. Jump ... do the Jump ... do the Jump The beautiful life is always damned You gotta fall into the quicksand A deadly kiss from a temptress can serve To make a truly wayward man.

So what if I stayed here...

rap	"Listen close to the story I'm about to tell It will never be repeated, so listen well And if you been around the way, some of you might know This girl we label as the project ho Project ho (variations on the phrase) If you looked half decent and you kicked it right She was bound to be yours for at least a night See, I was introduced to her by my cous' But that was before he told me who or what she was Me not knowin about this freak Pulled her off to the side and began to speak She had jet-black hair, big brown eyes She seemed to be smart conversation-wise I said, ""You look so good, as a matter of fact Here's my number, I ain't home, baby, call me back"" I didn't know if she was poor or filthy rich Cause my cousin didn't tell me nothin bout the bitch One thing I did know: I'm gonna get my thrill' Then I cold stepped off, and said, ""Baby, you chill"" You know that old saying 'if you're slow you'll blow' She was fast, so they labelled her the Project Ho I heard stories on the things that they said she'd do But when I seen her, I said, 'Nah, it can't be true' She was fair game, so I thought I'd play And never in my life will I forget this day I was chillin one night, I was all alone Noddin off but awaken by the ring of the phone To protect the guilty party, cause they mighta been stemmed We won't say her name, so we'll just say Kim What I heard her, goosepimples ran up my skin I said, ""How, how you're doin, and how have you been?"" She said, ""I'm doin fine, I hope you're doin the same Do you know who I am?"" ""Yeah, I remember your name"" I thought deep down that I peeped the card Kept sayin to myself she was on it hard I tried to be nice, tried to treat her kind But she had only one thing on her mind It always happens, well, wouldn't you know She said, ""I see you later, cause I got to go"" My cousin came home and said, ""Are you some fool? Being seen in the streets with a gardening tool"" I loooked up at him, cause I did not know He said, ""Kim, that skeezer, she's the project ho"" Me myself thought homie was dissin Despite all that I did not listen Wouldn't you believe it, she called me again And this was the line that I kicked then ""I love to see you, girl, and I don't know why Don't try to play post, cause you know you're fly So I'd like to come and see you if I may"" I was surprised as you when she said, ""Okay"" Now that that part was over and done ""Baby, what do you do at times to have fun?"" ""Depending on the weather and the mood that day Sip Dom Perrignon at a Broadway play The other things are not good to mention Like comin to my crib and relieve my tension"" I told her I was in love from the day we met After talkin for hours Kim said, ""Bet"" I had to let her go just to clear my line ""So I see you on Friday, let's say about 9"" From the things she said, why didn't I know The girl on my line was the project ho I took her out - fine's how it went But I better got somethin for the dough I spent Turned on the radio and heard (a world premiere) Turned to her and said, ""Where we go from here?"" The best part of it all, that thing that made it so treach The clothes we wore were the same as the stretch I recognized the look that was on her face And I yelled to the driver, ""Homeboy, my place"" We made it there in at least a half ""I got a choice of wines and a jaccuzzi bath"" You'll scream when I tell you what homegirl said ""Show me to the room with the king-sized bed"" I was rested real well, so I felt strong I knocked those boots that whole night long Right after she left, I started to itch Then I thought of what happened, then I said, ""That bitch!"" I went to see the doctor later on that day Cause when somethin is wrong, Jack, I don't play The doctor came over, this is what he said: ""You can't cure it with soup or layin up in your bed You're lucky that you came to see me early, my man Cause I guess that you know that you got it, Shan"" I said, ""Well, my man, that only goes to show: Believe em when they tell you she's the project ho"""

Quand le monstre s'assombrit, que les sourires diminuent C'est à cause des gratte-ciels que les nuages éternuent Alors l'orage gronde et la foudre précède un...

Beneath their haircut and clothes we're really all the same. They threaten our lives with nuclear war. Gonna cruficy us Just once more. Join the new church. Be a lord of the new church hey. Truth can't be found on the television. Throwaway youth Ya gotta take a stand. Music is your only weapon. Spanners In the works go start your gang..... New church. Join the New Church. Be a Lord Of The New Church. Lords Of The New Church - now.

rock	Rocking horse has turned to dust, Ashes on the line. Ship of dreams has turned to rust, Happens every time. Sewer turns to gold, Same old talk, seems old. I need a drink to keep my fever down. When the moon comes out shine, Spare the rod and pour some wine. Just keep on keepin on. I'll be hear when the carnival is gone. Lets go back to yesterday, If only for a song. Brother come on out and play, You can still sing along. Sewer turns to gold Same old talk, seems old. I roll the painted lady When I'm down. When the moon comes out shine, Hold the force and pour some wine. Just keep on Keepin on I'll be here for the carnival. One of these days you'll see the sound. Riding back 10 feet off the ground. Wanna stay lost until I'm found. Just keep on keepin on. I'll be hear when the carnival is gone. Sewer turns to gold Same old talk, seems old. I need another drink before I drown. When the moon comes out shine, Spare the rod and pour some wine. Just keep on keepin' on I'll be hear when the carnival is gone.
