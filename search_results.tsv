crazy rails train wounds mental	1	19.7	Não posso deixar que te leve O castigo da ausência, Vou ficar a esperar E vais ver-me lutar Para que esse mar não nos vença Não posso pensar que esta noite Adormeço sozinho, Vou ficar a escrever, E talvez vá vencer O teu longo caminho Quero que saibas Que sem ti não há lua, Nem as árvores crescem, Ou as mãos amanhecem Entre as sombras da rua Leva os meus braços, Esconde-te em mim, Que a dor do silêncio Contigo eu venço Num beijo assim Leva os meus braços, Esconde-te em mim, Que a dor do silêncio Contigo eu venço Num beijo assim Não posso deixar de sentir-te Na memória das mãos, Vou ficar a despir-te, E talvez ouça rir-te Nas paredes, no chão Não posso mentir que as lágrimas São saudades do beijo, Vou ficar mais despido Que um corpo vencido, Perdido em desejo Quero que saibas Que sem ti não há lua, Nem as árvores crescem, Ou as mãos amanhecem Entre as sombras da rua Leva os meus braços, Esconde-te em mim, Que a dor do silêncio Contigo eu venço Num beijo assim Leva os meus braços, Esconde-te em mim, Que a dor do silêncio Contigo eu venço Num beijo assim

You got money, cars, jewelry You think you got everything Lemme tell you, you ain't got nothin' You ain't got nothin' but a one way ticket to death row You gotta get out of the game man Or the game is gonna get you Now when I say high rollers, I mean the best Forget the half-steppers, eject the rest Because these high ranked officials of our city streets Make millions all triggered by electric beeps They dress in diamonds and rope chains They got the blood, Scarface runnin' through their veins Silk shirts, leather suits, hair always fresh Eelskin boots, large hearts, though their sizes vary Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry Cruisin' in their 500 Benz Sedan With their systems peaked out rockin' "Pusher Man" Yes, their fashion's high but hard to beat They buy their GUCCI at GUCCI'S, not the swap-meet Eat very well, much clientele Whatever you need, they probably sell High rollers Yeah and let me break it down for the ladies All you girls out there that think you gon' get that quick money and ain't goin' to jail You better think again Oh yes, I'm here to tell you females also roll Drive the same cars, sometimes wear more gold Cold as a igloo, or hot as a flame They'll shake ya, break ya and you won't know their name Gangsters to the max, all marks will be taxed These girls drive Ferrari's not Cadillacs Respect is demanded, most men don't understand it Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed They're junkies for fun, love life on the run And if things get hot, they will pull a gun Prey on the lame, no shame to the game And they all seek power, f*ck the fame The high rollers Yeah, the high rollers Street hustlers, the players Out there getting that long money, you know what I'm sayin' But that fast money leads to a fast life and a quick death This is my word, this is Ice-T And I ain't got no reason to lie to you Now radio stations probably won't play This record because of the things I say They'll say I'm glamorizing the hustlin' hood And a record like this can do no good But I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong I don't know which side of the law you belong Yes, the game has flash but sometimes hurts Behind any mistake, hard times lurks And jail's not your only problem, though it may seem You just may die by a barrage from a M-16 But to each his own, choose you mobile phone Choose a tailored suit, the luxury home You'll never get caught, 'cause you got nerves of ice And you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice Right You wanna be a high roller You wanna be a high roller

When I had plenty of good money, good people, My friends were all standing around, Just as soon as my pocket book was empty Not a friend on earth to be found. I've gambled all over Kentucky, good people, I've gambled part of the way through Spain. Going back to old Virginia For to gamble my last card game. Last time I seen my little woman, good people, She had a wine glass in her hand, She's a drinking down her trouble With a low-down sorry man. I wrote my woman a letter, good people, I told her I was in jail. She wrote me back an answer Saying "Honey, I'm a-coming to go your bail." All around this old jailhouse is haunted good people, Forty dollars won't pay my fine. Corn whisky has surrounded my body, poor boy, Pretty women is a-troubling my mind. Boys, if you don't quit your drinking Some time you'll be just like me; A working out your living In the penitentiary. Oh my daddy taught me a-plenty, good people, My mama, she told me more. If I didn't quit my rowdy ways I'd have trouble at my door. In the bottom of the whisky glass, The lurking devil dwells. It burns your breast to drink it, boys; It'll send your soul to Hell. Go dig a hole in the meadow, good people, Go did a hole in the ground. Come around all you good people And see this poor rounder go down. When I am dead and buried And my pale face turned to the sun, You can come around and mourn, little woman, And think the way you have done

crazy young oh-whoa fine time	10	16.4	One time I drove to see a girl across the country One night as I was driving through to Mexico I had the windows wide open It was cold and I was crying And I later laid her on the radio Then I stopped that side of Tahoe Through this tiny mining town At a diner to be filled for the ride And in the wind I heard this crying Like a heart broke cried a tune I turned my collar up and went inside. Well, I saw this smiling waitress Joshing friendly with these truckers That give her pats and she gives them shoves I said: Miss watch that awful crying Everybody laughed and said: It's the tomb of the unknown love And then they pointed out the window to this stone All by myself, beneath the tree, beside the hill And on that winter night I read these words alone These words that are haunting me still, it said: He lies a young man struck down in his prime By the awesome burning power of love He couldn't stand this true love cheating So he shot the girl down They hung him from that tree up ( right ) above I know that local folks say it's the wind But I know it's crying from the tomb of the unknown love. So I drove on to my destination I did the job my heart commanded of me And when the sheriff sirens came up I did believe and tried to find They counted ten, I came out at three So now I guess tomorrow morning Warden reads some kind of paper How I'm gonna pay the state for what I've done Hey, didn't they put their shackles on me And they'll take a little walk They won't have to drag me 'cause it's said and done And maybe someday they can put me at this stone All by itself, beneath the tree, beside the hill And lovers everywhere can come and meet alone These words that forgive them up to, and it'll say: He lies a young man.

(bis) C'est le deuxième couplet, j'espère qu'on va clipper. Tu pourras voir la tristesse de mon quartier. Ici tout est gris, ça s'appelle Paris. Les rues sont mortes, les filles décolorées. Pour rester bronzées, elles brûlent sous U.V. Toujours fâchée la fille de la ville est agressive comme un flic en civil. Y a comme une odeur de gaz sur les Champs-Elysées, et les bombes pètent dans le RER D. Ma mère est fatiguée, je la laisse se respirer. Je vis de mon côté et tente de subsister. Arrête de rapper me crie-t-elle toute la journée. Ce n'est pas sérieux, trouve un métier. Fumer ça donne faim, je suis Arsène Lupin. Je tape à E.D ; même sans les mains. Sur mon canapé, on est moins serré. C'est sûr certains se sont fait soulever. Je pense aux novices et n'oublie pas mes complices. REFRAIN J'veux porter des shorts toute ma vie. Avec mon escorte quitter Paris. Manger du poisson grillé sur la plage du Gosier. Prendre des bains de mer avec le Ministère. Mais je me suis noyé, je ne sais pas nager, les rues sont profondes et mènent toutes au Boulevard Ney. Comment s'en sortir pour la fille du quartier ? Elle croit que pour percer, il faut se faire trouer. Certains jouent au foot et veulent devenir pro. D'autres dealent et rêvent de kilos. Les seringues mortes se ramassent à la pelle sur les trottoirs de la rue La Chapelle. On protège nos fils de tout ce vice. Dans les cours d'école, on ne sniffe plus de colle. Drogue et alcool ont pris le monopole. Ma vie n'est pas simple, elle n'est pas funky. Moi je suis né ici et mon enfant aussi. REFRAIN

The truth you tried to keep from me, Well, it nearly drove me crazy, And I have grown weary from sleepless nights of you. Is that a broken heart in the corner of your eye, Something to remind you? You made this love a teardrop waiting to fall. There are those who can't love right. I just can't love wrong. When you are lonely in the night, how I hope you will recall you made this love a teardrop waiting to fall. No, I will not forgive you betraying trust between us, Though I will always care for you. I have loved you half my life, and when I give my heart again, I know that I'll remember love is but a fragile flame and trust just fuels the fire. When I think of all the years your love has taken from me, I can't believe I'm leaving you. You made this love a teardrop waiting to fall. There are those who can't love right. I just can't love wrong. When you are lonely in the night, How I hope you will recall you made this love a teardrop waiting to fall. You made this love a teardrop waiting to fall. There are those who can't love right. I just can't love wrong. When you are lonely in the night, How I hope you will recall you made this love a teardrop waiting to fall.

inside dna yeah loyalty royalty	1	15.8	When I'm alone in my room Sometimes I stare at the wall And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove For the first time in my life, I see I need love There I was, giggling about the games That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names Then the thought occurred, Tear drops made my eyes burn As I said to myself, "Look what you've done to her" I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal Playing make believe, pretending that I'm true Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you Saying amore, kissing you on the ear Whispering "I love you" and "I'll always be near" Although I often reminisce, I can't believe that I've found A desire for true love, floating around Inside my soul, because my soul is cold One half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old But the other half, needs affection and joy And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy I need love I need love Romance, sheer delight, how sweet I've got to find me a girl to make my life complete You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle Give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat Kiss you on the cheek and say "Ooh girl, you're so sweet" It's De Ja Vu, whenever I'm with you I can go on forever telling you what I'll do But where you at? You're neither here nor there I swear, I can't find you anywhere Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug This love search, is really making me bugged And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen? Take a chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean Fantasies can run, but they can't hide And when I find you I'ma pour all my love inside I need love I need love I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold you, just love you Suck on your neck, caress you and rub you Grind, mold, and never be alone If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad I've got money but love's something I never had I need your ruby red lips, sweet face and all I love you more than a man, who's ten feet tall I watch the sun rise, in your eyes We're so in love, when we hug, we become paralyzed Our bodies explode in extacy unreal You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I've never been there Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share Clean and unsoiled, yet sweaty and wet I swear to you, this is something I'll never forget I need love I need love See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger Friendship, trust, honor respect, admiration This whole experience has been such a revelation It's taught me love, and how to be a real man To always be considerate and do all I can Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much My body tingles all over with the slightest touch Of your hand, and understand, I'll be frozen in time Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine If I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man I'm not gonna leave it, in destiny's hand I can't sit and wait, for my princess to arrive I gotta struggle and fight, to keep my dream alive I'd search the whole world for that special girl And when I finally find you, watch our love unfurl I need love I need love Girl, listen to me. When I be sitting in my room, all alone, staring at the wall, Fantasies, they go through my mind. And, I've come to realize that, I need true love. And if you want to give it to me girl, make yourself seen. I'll be waiting, I love you.

You took my heart, Deceived me right from the start. You showed me dreams, I wish they would turn into real. You broke the promise and made me realize. It was all just a lie.
